<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this second series of the Fornander Collection of Hawaiian Folk-lore, with the
exception of a few transpositions, as mentioned in the preceding volume, the order
of the author has been observed in the main, by grouping together, first, the more
important legends and traditions of the race, of universal acceptance throughout the
whole group, followed by the briefer folk-tales of more local character.
</p>
<p>A few of similar names occur in the collection, indicating, in some cases, different
versions of the same story, a number of the more popular legends having several versions.
</p>
<p>The closing part of this volume, to embrace the series of Lahainaluna School compositions
of myth and traditional character, it is hoped will be found to possess educational
value and interest.
</p>
<p>No liberties have been taken with the original text, the plan, as outlined, being
to present the various stories and papers as written, regardless of historic or other
discrepancies, variance in such matters being treated in the notes thereto.

Hanamaulu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1777src" href="#xd32e1777">1</a> Kauai. There were five children in the family. The first was Kawelomahamahaia; the
second was Kaweloleikoo. These two were males; after these two came Kaenakuokalani,
a female; next to her was Kaweloleimakua and the last child was Kamalama. Kaweloleimakua,

<p>The parents of Malaiakalani [the mother] were people who were well versed in the art
of foretelling the future of a child, by feeling of its limbs, and by looking over
the child, they could tell whether it would grow up to be brave and strong, or whether
it would some day rule as king. At the birth of the two older brothers of Kawelo,
these old people examined them, but found nothing wonderful about them. This examination
was followed by the two on Kawelo, upon his birth. After the examination the old people
called the parents of Kawelo and said to them: “Where are you two? This child of yours
is going to be a soldier; he is going to be a very powerful man and shall some day
rule as king.” Because of these wonderful traits, the old people took Kawelo and attended
to his bringing up themselves. It was after this that Kamalama, the younger brother
of Kawelo was born.

<p>Shortly after the birth of Kamalama, the grandparents of Kawelo moved over to Wailua,
where they took up their residence, taking their grandchild Kawelo along with them.
At this time, while Kawelo was being brought up, Aikanaka, the son of the king of
Kauai was born, and also Kauahoa of Hanalei. All these three were born and brought
up together.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1786src" href="#xd32e1786">2</a>

<p>Kawelo as a child was a very great eater; he could not satisfy his hunger on anything
less than all the food of one <i lang="haw">umu</i> to a meal. Kawelo ate so much that his grandparents began to get tired of keeping
him in food, so at last they began to search for something to entice Kawelo away from
the house and in that way get him to forget to eat. One day they went up to the woods
and hewed out a canoe. After it was brought down to the sea shore it was rigged up
and given to Kawelo. As soon as Kawelo got the canoe he paddled it up and down the
Wailua river, and after this it became an object of great interest to him every day.

<p>When Kauahoa saw Kawelo with his canoe day after day enjoying himself, he got it into
his mind to make himself something to enjoy himself with; so he made <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>himself a kite, and after it was completed he flew it up. When Kawelo saw the kite
he took a liking to it and so went home to his grandparents and requested them to
make him a kite.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1798src" href="#xd32e1798">3</a> The grandparents thereupon made Kawelo a kite and after it was completed he took
it out and flew it up. When Kauahoa saw Kawelo with a kite he came with his and they
flew them together. While they were flying their kites, Kawelo’s kite became entangled
with Kauahoa’s kite which caused Kauahoa’s to break away and it was carried by the
wind till it landed at Koloa, to the west. The name of the place where the kite landed
is known as Kahooleinapea to this day, because of the fall of Kauahoa’s kite there.

<p>After Kauahoa’s kite was broken away, Kawelo looked at Kauahoa with the belief that
surely Kauahoa would come and attack him; but since Kauahoa did not come Kawelo said
within himself: “Kauahoa will never overcome me if we should ever meet in any future
battle.” Kauahoa was a much larger boy than Kawelo, still he was afraid of him.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1803src" href="#xd32e1803">4</a>

<p>After flying their kites, they went in swimming and riding down the rapids. In this
Kawelo again showed himself to be more skilful than Kauahoa, which caused Kawelo to
be more sure in his belief that Kauahoa will never overcome him in the future. Kawelo
and Kauahoa were not separated from one another in the matter of their relationship;
they were connected, and so was the young chief, Aikanaka. He was connected in blood
to the two boys, a fact which made Aikanaka something like an older brother and lord
to them. Everything Aikanaka wished was granted to him, whether in stringing wreaths,
or other things, they never denied him anything.

<p>While Kawelo and his grandparents were living at Wailua with Aikanaka and the others,
Kawelo’s older brothers, together with their grandparents, left Kauai and came to
live in Waikiki, Oahu. Kakuhihewa was the king of Oahu at this time. There was living
with Kakuhihewa, a very strong man who was a famous wrestler. This man used to meet
the older brothers of Kawelo in several wrestling bouts but they never could throw
him down. The brothers of Kawelo were great surf riders, and they often went to ride
the surf at Kalehuawehe.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1810src" href="#xd32e1810">5</a> After the surf ride they would go to the stream of Apuakehau and wash, and from there
they would go to the shed where the wrestling bouts were held and test their skill
with Kakuhihewa’s strong man; but in all their trials they never once were able to
throw him.

<p>While Kawelo was one day working in his fields, he heard some shouting down <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>toward the beach, so he inquired of his grandparents: “What is that shouting down
yonder?” The grandparents answered: “It is your brothers; they have been out surf
riding and are now wrestling with Kakuhihewa’s strong man. One of them must have been
thrown, hence the shouting you hear.” When Kawelo heard this he became very anxious
to go down and see it; but his grandparents would not consent.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1822src" href="#xd32e1822">6</a> On the next day, however, Kawelo went down on his own account and saw his older brothers
surf riding with many others at Kalehuawehe. He asked for a board which was given
him and he swam out with it to where his brothers were waiting for the surf, and they
came in together. After the surf riding, they went to the stream of Apuakehau and
took a fresh water bath; and from there they went to the shed where the wrestling
bouts were to be held. Upon their arrival at the shed Kawelo stood up with the strong
man to wrestle. At sight of this Kawelo’s older brothers said to him: “Are you strong
enough to meet that man? If we whose bones are older cannot throw him, how much less
are the chances of yourself, a mere youngster.” Kawelo, however, paid no heed to the
remarks made by his brothers, but stood there facing the strong man. At this show
of bravery the strong man said to Kawelo: “If I should call out, ‘Kahewahewa, it is
raining’,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1825src" href="#xd32e1825">7</a> then we begin.” Kawelo then replied in a mocking way: “Kanepuaa, he is biting, wait
awhile, wait awhile. Don’t cut the land of Kahewahewa, it is raining.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1830src" href="#xd32e1830">8</a> While Kawelo was having his say, the strong man of Kakuhihewa was awarded the privilege
of taking the first hold; and using his whole strength he attempted to throw Kawelo.
Kawelo was almost thrown, but through his great strength and skill he was not. Kawelo,
after mocking the man, took his hold and threw the strong man, who was thrown with
Kawelo on top of him. This delighted the people so much that they all shouted.

replied: “This is not the fishing ground. The place for fish is at the cape of Kaena.”
Kawelo also told Maakuakeke to sit securely in the canoe, lest he might be pitched
over. With one stroke of the paddle by Kawelo, they passed outside of Mamala;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1870src" href="#xd32e1870">10</a> with the second stroke they were at Puuloa;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1875src" href="#xd32e1875">11</a> and on the third stroke they arrived at Waianae. When they arrived off Waianae, Kawelo
picked up the <i lang="haw">kukui</i> nuts,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1883src" href="#xd32e1883">12</a> chewed them and then blew it on the sea to calm it, so that the bottom could be seen,

out into deep water, Maakuakeke knew that they would come to the place of Uhumakaikai<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1890src" href="#xd32e1890">13</a> (a marvelous fish); therefore Maakuakeke said to Kawelo in chant, as follows:

busy pulling up the uhu that they were overtaken by a rain and wind-storm. When Maakuakeke

Uhumakaikai, so he insisted on looking down at the bottom of the sea and blowing chewed
kukui nut over the surface of the sea. While he was busily doing this, Uhumakaikai
passed by. When Kawelo saw it, he reached for his net and made ready to catch the
great fish. As Uhumakaikai came nearer, he was caught in the net and immediately they

war could be waged against Aikanaka, who had taken unto himself all the lands owned

to go for Kawelo. These two were very loud-voiced men; if they called from Waikiki,
they could be heard at Ewa; and if they called from Ewa, they could be heard at Waianae.
It was because of this that these two men were sent by Kamalama to go for Kawelo.
Before they started out, Kamalama instructed them saying: “You two must remember the
names of these two men from Kauai, so that in case Kawelo should ask you who they
are you would be able to tell him their names. When you see Kawelo, keep at some distance
away from him and then inform him of your errand; don’t on any account get near him.”

Because they spoke of his god, Kawelo became very angry and wanted to kill the two
men, in order that they be used as sacrifice for his god. He therefore chased after
them, and they were almost caught, when they pointed their canoes and made for the
shoals within the line of breakers along the Waianae coast. When Kawelo saw this,
he followed right along behind the two. In doing this, Kawelo forgot about his fish
and it got stranded, so he made again for deep water. While he was doing this, the
two men arrived at Waikiki, where they told of their narrow escape from death. Kamalama
then said: “I warned you not to get too near to him.” While they were talking, Kawelo,
Maakuakeke and the great fish arrived; and Uhumakaikai was put ashore. As Kawelo landed,
Kauluiki, Kaulunui, Kauluwaho, Kaulukauloko, Kauluikialaalaa, Kauluaiole and Kaulupamakani,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2105src" href="#xd32e2105">24</a> came up all armed with their spears. These men were very skilful in the use of the
spear. When they came up to Kawelo, they began throwing their spears at him, which
Kawelo warded off, for they were as mere playthings<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2108src" href="#xd32e2108">25</a> to him. When the men were throwing their spears at Kawelo, the messengers from Kauai
said to Kawelo: “Say, you will surely get hit and be killed, and you will not be able
to get to Kauai.” Kamalama replied: “They are but as a bath to him.”

to eat, for I am hungry,” continued Kamalama. As soon as he got into the house, he
called out to their steward, Puikikaulehua: “Bring me some food and meat.” There were
brought forty large potatoes and forty packages of baked pork. Kamalama then sat down

said to her father: “There you are: I told you that my husband was bound to hear it,
because he has an all powerful god, Kalanikilo.” The father replied: “Yes, I see and
I am satisfied that your husband can hear all right. The talking was carried on in
Koolau and he has heard it in Kona.” Kanewahineikiaoha then said to Kawelo: “Let us
have something to eat first, and after that you can exercise with the war club.” Kawelo
refused, and he spoke very strongly to his wife, saying: “The pig’s intestine will
be full of dirt for it is to be killed.” By this reply made by Kawelo, his father-in-law
became very angry and said to Kawelo that they take up the war club first as requested
by Kawelo. He then ordered his son, Mauiakekai to stand up against Kawelo. When Kawelo

the use of his war club Kuikaa. As one side was killed by Kawelo, the canoe leaned
over on that side; Kawelo then swung his club along the other side killing all the
men there. In this slaughter, the two officers who were stationed at Wailua were also
slain. Kawelo then sent Kamalama and his adopted sons, Kaeleha, Kalaumeki and Kauluiki

<p class="first">As soon as Kamalama heard the orders of Kawelo, he immediately set his forces in order
of battle in three divisions. Kaeleha and some of Kauluiki’s companions were placed
on one side of the war canoe, Kalaumeki with the remainder of Kauluiki’s companions
were placed on the other side while Kamalama himself took up the central position.
In the battle that followed these preparations, none of Kawelo’s men were killed;
but Kauluiki and his companions were so afraid of the warriors of Kauai that they
gave up fighting and returned to their canoe. When Kawelo saw them coming, he asked
them: “How is the battle?” Kauluiki and his companions answered: “We are beaten. When
we left, your younger brother and adopted sons were on the point of being routed by
the opposing forces. We have therefore returned to inform you of this and to get our
canoe out to sea where we can wait for their return; but if they get killed, we will
be ready to return to Oahu.” When Kawelo heard this from Kauluiki and his companions,
he stretched out his feet against the mat and pulled the plaiting of the mat down,
thus making a slit in the mat and looked through it. When he looked through, he saw
the bravery of his brother Kamalama and adopted sons; they were on the point of routing
the Kauai forces, and he admired the courage of his [handful of] men. After this he
saw Kamalama and his men killing the men on the other side, while the few of the enemy
left were running up Nounou hill. On the top of this hill, Aikanaka the king and Kauahoa
the great warrior of Kauai had their camp. Kawelo was therefore very anxious lest
Kamalama’s forces suffer at the hand of Kauahoa; so he called to him in a chant as
follows:

<p>When Aikanaka was telling of the death of Kahakaloa by Kawelo, Kauahoa heard it, and
he took up his war club, called Kahehumakua, a first growth koa tree from Kahihikolo,
and proceeded on down the hill. (It is said that this war club, Kahehumakua, was a
very large one, for it was nothing else but a tree with its branches and leaves still
on; and when carried by Kauahoa, the birds would perch and sing in it.)
</p>
<p>When Kawelo saw Kauahoa coming down the hill and saw how large he was, casting a large
shadow because of his great height, he began to have some fear of his chances. When
Kauahoa arrived in the presence of Kawelo, Kawelo picked up his club and took his
stand by the side of Kanewahineikiaoha, his wife, to the right of Kauahoa; his brother
stood to the left of Kauahoa, and his adopted sons stood behind. As Kawelo stood up
with his war club, which was ten fathoms in length, the club with one end on the ground
only could reach to the middle of Kauahoa, showing that Kauahoa was about twenty fathoms
in height.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2762src" href="#xd32e2762">54</a> In standing thus, Kawelo was almost overcome with fear of Kauahoa, for Kawelo was
only educated in two ways of fighting with the war club; the stroke from the ground
upwards and the one from above downwards. He was not taught in the side strokes. Therefore,
Kawelo began to study how to overcome his opponent, but for a time he was undecided
what to do, which made him very uncertain of the outcome. This studying took him some
time and gradually his fears began to vanish, as he decided to fight until death ended
the battle.

<p>After the above conversation had taken place between Kaeleha and Aikanaka, rumors
of an uprising were carried to Kawelo at Hanamaulu, on the east of Kauai. Kawelo thereupon
sent a messenger to Kamalama in Kona with instructions to go and see,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3033src" href="#xd32e3033">78</a> and to find out for himself as to the truth of these rumors that had come to him.
As soon as the messenger arrived in the presence of Kamalama, the message of his brother,
Kawelo, was repeated to him. When Kamalama heard the instructions, he proceeded to
Waimea, then on to Hanapepe and Wahiawa. When he reached Wahiawa, he saw a great number
of people on the plain of Kalae gathering stones; men and women and children. While
Kamalama was standing looking at the people, a man came up to him, so he asked: “What
are the people doing over there on the plain?” The man replied: “They are gathering
stones.” “Stones for what?” asked Kamalama. “For Kaeleha and Aikanaka to fight Kawelo.”
Kamalama was thus made sure that the rumors heard by Kawelo were only too true. He
then retraced his steps and went direct to his home and dispatched a messenger to
Kawelo to inform him of what he had seen.

<p>In this battle we will see how brave and powerful Kawelo really was, because, although
he was all by himself, he fought against the multitude that opposed him. In the fight,
Kawelo was not able to dodge the stones that were hurled at him, for a great many
of them were thrown at the same time, therefore he stood in one place while the stones
were hitting him from all sides. In course of time, Kawelo was completely covered
by the stones, the stones rising until his height was reached. When Kawelo saw this,
he pushed the stones from off him and for a time he would be free; but this was only
for a very short while, for the stones would come so fast that again he would be covered.
This was continued until Kawelo began to grow weaker and weaker, so that finally he
was unable to push the stones away from him. After a while the mound <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>of stones over Kawelo grew higher and higher, when at last nothing else could be seen
but a great mound of stones which was like a grave for Kawelo.
</p>
<p>When the people saw that Kawelo was entirely covered over with stones, they believed
that they had killed him, for they were sure that none could live in such a hail of
stones as was cast at Kawelo. The people then ceased throwing and they came and took
the stones from off of Kawelo. After a while he was found all bruised from head to
feet and, to all appearances, lifeless. They then took up his body and began to beat
it with clubs, after which they leaned over him and listened to see if he was alive
or dead. After a while they made sure that Kawelo was indeed dead, and they proclaimed
that Aikanaka was the king of Kauai.

all Kawelo was not really killed. It seemed that he still had a little spark of life
within him, and in course of time he came to life again. But this was not known; consequently,

Koloa,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3059src" href="#xd32e3059">79</a> and this place can be seen to this day. But since its completion no human sacrifice
had been offered upon its altar. Kawelo was therefore carried from Wahiawa to Koloa.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3062src" href="#xd32e3062">80</a> The distance from Wahiawa to Koloa is something like the distance between Honolulu
and Luakaha, about six miles. When Kawelo’s body was at last brought to the temple,
it was carried and left within the enclosure that stood inside of the temple, near
the altar, with the idea of leaving it there over night, before placing it on the

left in the enclosure, covered over with banana leaves.
</p>
<p>After remaining in a deep sleep as it were for some time, Kawelo woke up and felt
that he was greatly relieved from his bruises. He also felt that his strength had
returned to him, and gradually he realized that he was at last saved from a terrible
death. He then planned how he was to deal out his vengeance to all his enemies and
particularly his son Kaeleha and Aikanaka.

the night when Kawelo was lying covered up with banana leaves, at about midnight,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>at the time when the Milky Way turns, Kawelo felt his strength returning to him and
his bruises became less painful. He therefore rose and walked back and forth, impatiently
waiting for the coming of day, when he expected to see Aikanaka and Kaeleha and the
others enter the temple. Where Aikanaka and his followers had gone to spend the night
was at a place some distance away, but before leaving he had placed a guard over Kawelo.
This guard was a close friend of Kawelo’s. When Kawelo rose, the man saw that he was
come back to life again, so he asked: “Is that you?” Kawelo answered: “Yes, it is
I.” Kawelo then asked the guard: “Where are Aikanaka and his followers?” The guard
replied: “They have retired for the night.” Kawelo again asked: “Are they not coming
back again?” The guard replied: “They are coming back here in the morning.”

king and in time all the powers and privileges that were formerly Pakaa’s were taken
out of his hands and given over to these two men, Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna, except
the personal effects of the king; these the king left with Pakaa. Because of this
want of faith in him, Pakaa left the presence of the king and wandered off heavy hearted
and in great grief over the actions of the king, for he did not want to be ordered
about by anyone. In this departure of Pakaa he took with him the kapas, malos and
all the personal effects of Keawenuiaumi and placed them within his calabash, Laamaomao.

“Point the bow of the canoe for the small canoe; possibly it has <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>a word for us.” The reason why the king said this was because while Pakaa had command
of his canoe, it was his custom to make a call on any canoe that made signals of this
kind; hence the king being accustomed with this, ordered that the canoe be directed
for the small one. When the king’s canoe drew near, Pakaa asked of his son: “Where

I was willing to land, but these fellows were so learned. I thought they were indeed
learned, but I have found that they are not.” Kuapakaa said: “There, you have faced
disaster. Come ashore at the boy’s landing.” The king then expressed his willingness
to land. Kuapakaa then said to the king: “Say, listen to me; we will go in first and
when I beckon to you, you may come, because the passage way is crooked, and furthermore
the proper time for making a landing is past. Had you consented to make land at my

<p>Pakaa and his son therefore entered the passageway first, and when they stopped they
beckoned to the king’s canoe as well as the others to come in. This zigzag was continued
until they were almost in, when Pakaa said to the boy: “Say, let us paddle in; you
must exert all your strength, that we may land before the others.” With this the two
worked with all their might and made land before the others. Pakaa then jumped ashore
and ran into the house reserved for the preparation of food, thinking that in this
house he would be safe, for such houses were never entered by kings. When Pakaa jumped
from the canoe, Lapakahoe saw and thought he recognized Pakaa by the limp he made

<p>Kuapakaa therefore took up the loin cloth and returned to Keawenuiaumi. When he came
to the king’s presence he said: “Here is my loin cloth, you can use it and let me
take your wet one.” Keawenuiaumi reached out for the loin cloth and looked at it,
and saw that it looked like his own, the kind he used to wear when Pakaa had charge.
At seeing this, Keawenuiaumi said: “Say, this loin cloth looks just like my own.”
Kuapakaa replied: “This is my own loin cloth, but you being the king, I give it to
you.” Kuapakaa then took the wet one and returned to Pakaa, who said to him: “Hang
up your master’s loin cloth over the door way, so that the people will not try to
enter this house. You can enter it and can go out, because all the sacred things belonging

“It belongs here in Molokai.” Keawenuiaumi said: “There are no kapas in other places
like those of Hawaii; and they are not common with other chiefs. I am the only one
who possesses such things. I believe this is my kapa. It must be that Pakaa is here.”
“It was my mother that made this kapa for my own use, for my mother is a chiefess

food I will be supplied during the time of planting and care of a new crop.” This

when good weather once more prevailed. The men, in obedience to this order, faithfully
kept all the small potatoes after every cooking day.

<p>When Keawenuiaumi left Hawaii on this expedition, he left word with the chiefs and
the common people that he would take up a month in the search for Pakaa. He was, however,
mistaken in this, for he was in Molokai for four months. In this prolonged absence
the people of Hawaii began to mourn for their king, believing that he was dead. After
staying in Molokai for four months, the followers of Keawenuiaumi began to think of
their wives, children and parents, and there was a general feeling amongst them that
they abandon the search for Pakaa and return to Hawaii.

canoes and set sail, and when out at sea they hove to and awaited for the canoe of
Keawenuiaumi, which was to come later; for the king had given them his order to go
to sea and await his coming. In waiting for the king, the chiefs allowed their canoes
to drift away; and in drifting they all fell asleep. The men who were anxious to get
back home then headed the canoes for Kawaihae in Kohala, Hawaii; at daylight the next
day, the chiefs awoke and when they looked about them they saw that the land in sight
was Hawaii. Instead of getting angry, they felt happy, for they knew that they were
about to see their wives and children; they, however, felt some regrets, for they

<p class="first">When Kuapakaa saw that the enemies of his father, Pakaa, were dead, he closed the
wind calabash, Laamaomao, and immediately the storm abated and a great calm came over
the ocean. At the coming of the pleasant weather, the office of sailing master was
given over to the boy. But before this, the king said to the boy, that he wished to
continue the search of Pakaa at Kaula. After giving this order the king and the men
all fell asleep, for they were worn out with the efforts to save themselves during
the storm.

<p>After they had all fallen asleep a fair wind from land sprung up; Kuapakaa then swung
the canoe around as well as the sail and sailed straight for Hawaii, all that day
and night until daylight of the next day, when they saw the top of Maunakea above
the mist, passing and repassing in the distance like a pointed cloud. At this the
men all woke up at the call, “There is Hawaii.” Some said that it was not Hawaii;
but when they got nearer to Kawaihae, they were made certain that it was Hawaii. This
was the cause of great rejoicing amongst the men; but Keawenuiaumi was not at all
made happy for he had failed to find his servant Pakaa, and had not reached Kaula.

<p>As the canoe drew near the land the men became excited, for they were to see their
wives and children after a long separation. Upon seeing this, Kuapakaa said to them:
“Say, what a disappointment it will be for the boy.” They asked: “Why?” Kuapakaa replied:
“He will be neglected as soon as the canoe touches land.” Lapakahoe then asked: “Why
should you be neglected?” Kuapakaa replied: “I see that you are all excited and are
anxious to land; and when you do, and meet your wives and children you will forget
me and I will get left, for I have no friends here.” Lapakahoe said: “The king will
not forget you, because by you these bones were saved.” “That may be so, but the boy
will be forgotten as soon as the canoe touches land.” These words of Kuapakaa were

<p>Some time after this, Kuapakaa heard that the season for flying-fish had commenced
at Kohala, so very early one morning he came upon a couple of fishermen, who were
fastening on the lashings of their canoe, making preparations for going out fishing
for flying-fish. When he saw the men, he said: “What are you two going to do with
the canoe?” “We are making ready to go out fishing for flying-fish.” “Will you let
me accompany you in your canoe?” “No, it will be too much of an extra load for the
canoe<span class="corr" id="xd32e5289" title="Source: ?">.</span>” Kuapakaa replied: “Do you think so? I believe every canoe ought to have a bailer.
If I accompany you, I know that I don’t share with you on your catch. I know how to
fish, and if I make a large catch, I will have to share with the rowers; and even
if the catch be small, I must share with you on my catch. In this way, you can see,
I will not in any way be entitled to a division of your catch.” As the boy spoke pleasantly
and in a way, wisely, the men gave their consent and expressed their willingness to
take Kuapakaa along with them.

<p>Upon coming to the fishing grounds, several flying-fish were caught, a fair division
was then made and they headed for home. On their return they met a canoe which was
manned by six paddlers, while the canoe in which Kuapakaa was a paddler had only three.
When Kuapakaa saw the other canoe, he said to his two companions: “Let us have a race
with that canoe, and make a wager,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5294src" href="#xd32e5294">42</a> our flying-fish, that we can beat them.” This proposition angered one of his companions,
who said: “Why, who said so? How can you beat six men in a canoe race?” Kuapakaa said
to the one who made the answer: “You had better get into that other canoe, making
seven of you, and the two of us will race the seven of you.”

<p>The other man then replied: “I am afraid I will be deprived of my share of our catch.
How can our strength be compared to the strength of all such full grown men? We will
never be able to beat them.” When Kuapakaa heard this, he said to the man: “You can
take the other canoe then, making eight of you, while I shall take this canoe all
by myself; and let us place our shares as our wagers. If you get ashore first, you
can have my catch and if I make land first I will take your catch.”
</p>
<p>This satisfied the others and they asked that Kuapakaa hand over his share of the
fish for them to hold; but to this Kuapakaa replied: “No, I think you ought to give
me the fish and I act as the stake-holder; because if I beat you, you will be apt
to keep the stakes, and if I jump in to take it from you, you would beat me, for there
are too many of you and I am all alone. But on the other hand, if you beat me, I will
not be able to keep the stakes away from you for you are too many for me, you can
take the stakes away from me anyhow.” There was nothing wrong in this, so it was agreed,
and the fish were handed over to Kuapakaa. Soon after this, the preparations for the
race commenced and the canoes were brought to the mark. As soon as the word was given,
the paddles all came down with a jerk and away the two canoes went.

<p>On the start the canoe containing the eight men took the lead, while the one containing

after the call, a large surf came from behind him and then another and another; <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>by these surfs he was taken ashore. The other people, when they saw the surfs coming,

another race, saying to Kuapakaa: “Let us have another race.” Kuapakaa replied: “You
can satisfy yourselves on that matter; but the trouble is I have nothing to wager
against you.” They all said: “There is always one wager, our bones. If we beat you,
you forfeit your life to us, and if you should beat us, why we forfeit ours.” Kuapakaa

our starting point.” Kuapakaa agreed to this; the canoes were swung around, placed
side by side, and when they were ready the word was given and the race commenced.
On the start the eight men forged their canoe ahead by their powerful strokes of the
paddle, while Kuapakaa fell far behind. Upon seeing this Kuapakaa watched how the
others were using their paddles, and when he saw them raise their paddles some distance
out of the water, and that they held their paddles high up by which action the water
was forced up high at every stroke, causing an eddy to be drawn along behind their
canoe, he forced his canoe into the current formed by the eddy behind the other canoe.
As soon as he had entered into this current all he had to do was to see that his canoe
kept in the current. While the others were forcing themselves to keep ahead of the
boy, by using very powerful strokes, the boy followed on behind taking his time; and
the faster they went the faster the boy followed them. Whenever the boy saw that the
others were slackening up he would call out: “Pull harder so you will win.” When the
eight men would hear this, they worked all the harder.

<p>When the canoes drew near to the land, the boy’s canoe being directly behind the other,
so that he was not clearly seen, the people ashore began to dispute as to the merits
of the two canoes, and seeing only one canoe, the people yelled out: “The boy is beaten,
the boy is beaten.” After the shouts had ceased, the canoe of Kuapakaa was seen to
come out from behind the other and take the lead, causing the multitude backing the
boy to raise another shout, for they admired the pluck displayed by the youngster.
The canoe of Kuapakaa was seen to draw away from the others farther and farther until
it reached land first. As soon as Kuapakaa touched shore he grabbed a surf board and
swam out to the surf, according to agreement, but instead of going <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>out to the big surf he took the small ones near the sand, and after he had thus ridden
in three times, the eight men landed and were declared beaten by the boy.

<p>The result of this race was soon carried to Keawenuiaumi, as well as the fate of the
eight men, who were fairly beaten by the boy. When Keawenuiaumi heard this, he said:
“Yes, it surely must be so. If that small boy is the same one that came along with
us then it is possible. If he is the same, then there is no escape, the men will indeed
die.” Keawenuiaumi then sent one of his messengers to go and bring the boy to him,
in order that he might see for himself. When the boy arrived, the king saw that it
was the very same that had accompanied him to Hawaii. At this the king fell on the
boy’s neck and wept, because he knew that he had neglected him since leaving the canoe.
The actions of the boy in saving him from death came to the mind of the king in such
a way that he felt that he had indeed been neglectful.

that we wager some property and at this they questioned me what property I had to

<p>When he reached their home, the boy greeted his father and after the exchange of the
greetings, Pakaa inquired: “Are my opponents dead?” “Yes. After we had sailed off
and while outside of Waimea, Kauai, I uncovered Laamaomao and immediately we were
encompassed by a great and terrible storm. In the midst of this storm, I gave out
the palm leaves to the men, all with the exception of Hookeleihilo and Hookeleipuna.
The food also was not given them, nor the meat and water; and being exhausted, the
two died. We then left Kauai and set sail for Hawaii while all the people were asleep,
and after a time we landed at Kawaihae, where I was neglected by my master and his
men. Some time shortly after this I got into a race with some of the king’s men whom
I defeated and they were put to death. After the men were put to death I told the
king of you and me, and he sent me to bring you; therefore, I have come for you to
go back with me.” At this Pakaa asked: “What has your master given you?” “Nothing.”
“Then go back and tell your master that Pakaa has sent word that until the king has
restored all the lands taken back by him, as well as all the other things, I will
not come back.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e5359src" href="#xd32e5359">43</a> Restore these things and I will come.”

who was born in Kamooloa, in Koloa, Kauai; but he was brought up in the temple of
Humuula. Palila at his birth was in the form of a piece of cord<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6254src" href="#xd32e6254">1</a> and was therefore thrown away in a pile of rubbish, the parents not knowing that
it was a child, and furthermore they were disappointed upon seeing the cord. When
Palila was born, Hina [the grandmother] was living in the temple of Humuula up in
the mountains; but through her supernatural powers she saw the birth of Palila, so
she came down to Mahinui and Kaluaopalena and asked them: “Where is the child that
was born a short time ago?” Mahinui and Kaluaopalena replied: “There was no child,
it was a piece of cord; it is lying there in that rubbish pile.” Hina went over to
the place and took up the piece of cord from amongst the rubbish and bundled it up
in a piece of white kapa and returned to her home.

<p>After Hina arrived at her home in the temple of Humuula, away up in the mountains
in a very lonely spot, she unwrapped the bundle of Palila and put it into another
piece of white kapa. This was done at three different times, when it began to assume
human form. After the lapse of a full period of ten days, the body of Palila was complete
in its form. Hina then built a shelf from the <i lang="haw">uluhe</i> fern and placed the child upon it. After the child had reached the age when it could
take food, it was given nothing but bananas.

<p>Alanapo was another very sacred place; it was also a temple and was located in the
land of Humuula. It was the resort of spirits and a place noted for the strength and
braveness of the people brought up in it. When Hina saw that the child was full grown
she took him to the temple of Alanapo and brought him up with the spirits, where he
was educated in the arts of warfare and in all the training proper for the development
of great strength. After the years of training his two hands were equally developed
and could deal out death to all his enemies. In his daily life and bringing up, he
had a twofold character; that of a spirit and of a human being.

<p>It was Hina’s usual custom to go down to observe the progress of the contending parties;
she did this every time there was a battle. On this occasion Hina went down and arrived
before the commencement of hostilities; she felt<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6283src" href="#xd32e6283">2</a> that Palila was coming down to see the battle, so upon meeting Kaluaopalena she said
to him: “You must be on the watch this day. The first warrior who will come to you

will be Palila, your own son, who comes from the temple of Alanapo. He will be the

<p>Soon after Hina departed on her way to see the battle, Palila woke from his sleep.
When he looked about him and saw that Hina was not around, he rose, took up his war
club, Huliamahi by name, given to him by the gods, and came out of the sacredness
of Alanapo. He continued on his way until he was outside of the limits of Humuula,
and went through a forest of tall trees until he arrived at a rise looking toward
the sea. This rise is Komoikeanu. When Palila arrived at this rise he looked down
and saw two great armies gathered at Paa. Palila knew by the action of the men that
a battle was about to be fought and against his father Kaluaopalena. He therefore
turned and proceeded along the upper part of Hanapepe through the brush and tall trees.
When Palila got into the forest he swung his club, Huliamahi, knocking down the trees.
By reason of the falling of the trees one on top of another, they kept on falling
until the trees standing around one of the armies were also knocked down, destroying
a large portion thereof, leaving Kaluaopalena’s intact. Those who heard Hina announce
the coming of Palila were all afraid upon seeing the forest mowed down, therefore
Namakaokalani immediately sent his messengers to ask Kaluaopalena to call off the
battle and to make peace.

<p>When Kaluaopalena heard the message, he refused to call the battle off, saying: “I
will not call the battle off until I am victorious, for I have laid awake nights until
my head was made heavy planning for this battle. I know that I will conquer the whole
of Kauai this day.” The reason why Kaluaopalena said this was because he had heard
that Palila was coming to meet him, and it was also this which caused the other side
to sue for peace. On whichever side Palila swung his club no trees or shrubs remained
standing, and none grow to this day.

Palila, and when near him fell flat, face down, and called out: “Ye heavenly offspring,
hold out your club.” Palila inquired: “Where shall it be? Toward the uplands, toward
the lowlands, to the east or downward?” Kaluaopalena answered: “At the killing of
the pig and the red fish.” Palila then pushed his war club, Huliamahi, downward until
only the point of it remained above ground. That was the land of Waihohonu, therefore
its miry condition to this day and its deep depression. At this all the people fell

<p>It was a law with Palila that whenever he laughed the kapu would end; people could
then stand up, speak, or run about. The people did not, however, know this, so they
remained lying down. While they were all in this position Hina arrived and she stood

herself to nakedness, and rolled over the backs of the people, which caused Palila

<p>Kamaikaahui’s occupation was that of a farmer, and to suit his taste he had his fields
near the public highway. While at his work he could see the people on their way sea
bathing or on their way to fish. As people passed down he would ask: “What <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>kind of bathing are you going to have?” “We are going to leap from the rocks.” He
would then say: “Your feet will be bitten.” After the people had passed on their way
to the sea, he would then follow on behind and jump into the sea and begin to bite
off the feet of the bathers. This was carried on every time the people went bathing
and they never once suspected him. If the people were on their way to dive for fish

<p>It was his custom to always have a piece of kapa wrapped around his back and he never
went without it, because it was to cover up the mouth at his back, for he did not
wish to have it seen. One day during one of the king’s working days at which Kamaikaahui

order was therefore issued in which everybody was requested to uncover their back.
This was followed by everybody except Kamaikaahui. When he was requested to uncover
his back he at once attempted to escape and ran off, threw down his clothes and jumped

where he shall be kept under a strict kapu until we have worked over him and have
transformed him into a perfect human being, when everything will be well.” Palila

it floated in the sea; he then jumped in the fore part of the canoe and took up nine
paddles while Kahului jumped into the after part and took up his paddle. After they
were ready to start Palila took up one paddle and with one stroke broke it in two;
so he took up another paddle and that too was broken; this was kept up until all the
nine paddles were broken. Kahului then said to Palila: “Let us return for we have
no more paddles to work the canoe with.” Palila then took up his war club and used
it as a paddle; he took but one stroke and they went skimming along beyond Kawaihoa,
then on to Kolo, the great fishing grounds.

of Koolauloa and Koolaupoko. Puniakaia was a very handsome man and had not a single
blemish from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. He was erect, front and
back, and so on the sides. While Puniakaia was living with his parents, a desire to
go fishing came upon him, so he accompanied his mother to the beach and they went
fishing. The kind of fish caught by them was the kind called pauhuuhu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6607src" href="#xd32e6607">2</a> but only one. This fish was brought home alive and was saved by Puniakaia; being
fed and taken care of until it grew to be a very large fish; and to it was given the
name of Uhumakaikai.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6616src" href="#xd32e6616">3</a> This fish was the parent of all the fishes. After Puniakaia had brought up Uhumakaikai
until it was full grown, he turned it into the ocean, free from all confinement.

to Puniakaia; the fish reached from way down deep in the sea to the surface, and they
were driven clear up onto the sand. Upon seeing this the people began taking up the
fish; some were salted, some given away to the people, and so on, from the Makapuu
point to the Kaoio point at Kualoa. With all this great number of people taking the
fish, still there was a large number left, there being so many; and the people had
to leave a great many behind and the pigs and dogs ate of them. Rumors of this great
catch were soon carried to the hearing of Kaalaea,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6640src" href="#xd32e6640">4</a> a very beautiful woman, who had no equal in all the land of Koolau; she was just

<p>When they arrived at Kou,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6717src" href="#xd32e6717">12</a> they left the canoe there and proceeded up Nuuanu, where they looked down toward
Kaneohe and they saw the house with its open doorway as described by Puniakaia. The
men then proceeded on down to the house and found Halekou the mother of Puniakaia
sitting on some mats. The men extended their greetings and Halekou returned the same.
Halekou then asked the men: “What has brought you here?” The men replied: “We have
come on the request of a boy by the name of Puniakaia.” When Halekou heard this, she
wept as well as the chiefs and common people, and said: “We thought that Puniakaia
was dead; but we see now that he is still alive. What has he requested you to do?”
“He told us that we come and tell you that you go and call for his fish, Uhumakaikai,
and request that it drive some fish to Kauai; because Puniakaia made a wager with
the king of Kauai, that in fifteen days he could catch a certain amount of fish, and
that if this amount of fish was not caught within this given time, Puniakaia would
be killed. Now this is the twelfth day and we have only three days left if Puniakaia
is to be saved.” When Halekou heard this, she said: “I am afraid the fish will not
obey my call; for he is the only one that could make the fish do his bidding; but
I shall go and try.”

<p>Maniniholokuaua lived at Kaunakakai in Molokai, while his lizard grandmother lived
in the uplands at a place called Kalamaula, in a large cave which served her as a

canoe taking with him his nets, plenty of food and all other things necessary for

called out to him: “Say, Keliimalolo, bring your canoe and leave it in the canoe shed,
otherwise it will be stolen by Maniniholokuaua, the boy who steals and carries away
canoes.” Keliimalolo then replied: “How can he get away with my canoe, is he a fast

canoe alone; don’t take it.” While Keliimalolo was talking, Maniniholokuaua lifted

able to catch up with Maniniholokuaua. As soon as Maniniholokuaua arrived at the cave,

<p>Because of this loss of his canoe, he immediately returned to Oahu and soon after
set out for Kauai, in search of some one who would be able to return him his canoe.
He wished to get a good runner. On this trip to Kauai he first landed at Mana; after
he landed he carried his canoe ashore and went for a swim. Upon coming to the pool
he disrobed and jumped in. Just as he got into the water, Kamaakamikioi and Kamaakauluohia
arrived from Niihau. They were the sons of Halulu. These two men were noted for their
fleetness and could make ten circuits of Kauai in one day. Being very swift they could
run on land and sea and from the earth to the skies. They were greater runners than
either Keliimalolo or Maniniholokuaua. As soon as they arrived at the pool they picked
up the malo of Keliimalolo and ran away with it. Keliimalolo got out of the pool and
started to chase the two to try and recover his malo; but he could not catch up with
them. The two ran out onto the sea, on the surface, and when at some distance from
the shore they stood and looked at Keliimalolo. Keliimalolo <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>then called out to them, saying: “You two come ashore and let us be friends.” After
the two had come ashore Keliimalolo said to them: “You two will be the means of restoring
to me what I have lost.” He then related to them his trip to Molokai and how his canoe
was stolen by Maniniholokuaua. After the two had listened to the narrative, they said
to Keliimalolo: “You return to Oahu and in the nights of Kane, we will come. When
you see two narrow pointed clouds hanging in the horizon make sure that the clouds
are ourselves and we will come soon after that.” The two then asked Keliimalolo: “Let
us all make a circuit of Kauai in one day.” This was consented to by Keliimalolo.

While the canoe was still in mid-ocean, Maniniholokuaua looked and saw a canoe approaching;
so said to his grandmother, Kalamaula: “There is my canoe, there is my canoe.” Kalamaula
replied: “You must not attempt to steal that canoe as I have a premonition that the

Maniniholokuaua said to his friends: “There is the boy.” Keliimalolo then called out:
“Leave my canoe alone; you must not take it.” Heedless of the call, Maniniholokuaua
took up the canoe, placed it on his back and ran off at the top of his speed. <span class="corr" id="xd32e6830" title="Source: Kamaamikioi">Kamaakamikioi</span> then said: “I am going after that fellow. If you see a fire burning, it is a sign

up, O cave,” and Kamaakamikioi thereupon called out: “Close up, O cave.” No sooner
than the cave was opened it immediately closed again catching Maniniholokuaua and
the canoe in its jaws, killing Maniniholokuaua. Kamaakamikioi then called out: “Open
up, O cave.” The cave opened and he entered in. He found Kalamaula and she was killed.
When he looked about the cave he saw that it was filled with canoes of every description
and many things of great value. He then went out of the cave to light the fire, and
when the people saw it they all came up to the cave and carried away the valuables;
but the people of the whole of Molokai were unable to carry away all of the things
in the cave.

of which had not been seen before him nor since. He could keep asleep from the first
day of the month to the end of the month; but if a thunder storm occurred he would
then wake up; otherwise he would keep on sleeping for a whole year. If he should be
walking along the road and should become sleepy, he would then sleep without once
getting up, until it thundered, when he would get up and would stay awake for days
and nights at a time, in summer and in winter. So would it be if he was out in the
ocean; if he fell asleep, he would sleep in the sea until it thundered, when he would
wake up. He was without equal in his extraordinary behavior.

<p>Once upon a time Opelemoemoe set out from Kalauao for Puukapolei, where he fell asleep.
He slept for a period of nearly ten days; it perhaps lacked two days, when a couple
of men arrived from Kauai, who were on their way in search of a human sacrifice for
the temple of Lolomauna, at Pokii, Kauai. These men upon seeing Opelemoemoe tried
to wake him up, but in this they were unsuccessful. They then carried him on their
backs to Pokai,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6868src" href="#xd32e6868">2</a> at which place their canoes were moored, placed him in the canoe and carried him
off to Kauai. After landing they again carried Opelemoemoe and placed him on the altar
in the temple of Lolomauna, together with a pig, some bananas, some coconuts and some
awa. During all this time Opelemoemoe never once awoke from his sleep. It was noticed
that his body did not decay like the rest of the things that were placed on the altar;
for the bananas, the pig, the fish and the awa all rotted. Opelemoemoe was then left
on the altar until one day it thundered, when he awoke and found himself tied hand
and foot. He then untied himself and got down from the altar.

<p>One day Opelemoemoe felt sleepy, and said to his wife, Kalikookalauae: “I am falling
off to sleep, so don’t attempt to wake me up. If our friends should come don’t disturb
me; if fortune should come do not awaken me; if you should be in danger, don’t arouse
me; and don’t ever complain, but just leave me alone and don’t wake me up, for I have
placed a kapu over it.” Opelemoemoe then fell off to sleep. This sleep was continued
for ten days,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6877src" href="#xd32e6877">3</a> and still another ten days. At this extraordinary length of time taken up in his
sleep, Kalikookalauae said to herself: “How strange this is! I had no idea of the
length of time you were going to sleep, but I see you sleep like a dead person.” She
then tried to wake him up; she shook him, poured water in his eyes, made <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>some noise and still he slept on. She then called for her brothers, Popoloau and Kawaikoi,
and her servants Poo and Mahamaha, to come in. When they arrived she said: “The chief
is dead; let us wrap him up and carry him off and cast him into the sea.” The brothers
and men then did as they were told, and cast him into the sea. Opelemoemoe slept on
as though he was on land, never once moving. In this sleep the fish came around and

<p>After some months had lapsed, during which time Opelemoemoe slept on at the bottom
of the sea, a thunder storm came up and Opelemoemoe awoke. When he looked about him,
he saw that he was at the bottom of the sea, all wrapped up and bound with cords.
He then sat up and began to untie himself, and after he was free from the cords he
came to the surface and swam ashore. He had no skin, he was covered with sores and
was unable to walk; so he crawled to a pig pen where he sat down; from this place
he crawled to another house where a priest was living who gave him some medicine and

you to keep this my word. If you should give birth to a boy, give him the name of

me let have this token,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e6888src" href="#xd32e6888">4</a> a spear.” The wife lived on by herself until she gave birth to a boy to whom she
gave the name of Kalelealuaka. She brought him up until he was big. He was a great
mischief-maker and would often urinate in the calabash of food and such other mischievous
acts. Because of this, his step-father often punished him; when Kalelealuaka would
run off to his mother crying and would demand of her that she tell him of his father.
The mother would then tell him that he had no other father than the one who was living
with them. As this was continued for some time the mother at last told him, saying:
“Yes, you have a different father; he is in Kalauao, Oahu, in the district of Ewa,
in the village of Kahuoi; his name is Opelemoemoe.” Kalikookalauae then handed Kalelealuaka
the spear left by Opelemoemoe as the token by which he was to recognize his son.

of the big man, he twirled his war club, Heleleikukaemakuu, first above, then sideways,
then downwards and at last made a swinging motion. In all these motions the big man
stood in one position and made no attempt to swing his war club. By this Piimaiwaa
made sure it was but a wooden man. He therefore approached it and tapped it with his

<p class="first">Keahuolu was the father and Lanihau was the mother of Hiku, a boy. These people once
lived in Kaumalumalu in the district of Kona, island of Hawaii. Hiku lived with his
parents in the uplands of Kaumalumalu until he was grown up. He was of very handsome
appearance and was very pleasant to look upon. After he was grown into manhood he
left home one day and started down towards the lowlands with his sugar-cane arrow
called Pua-ne. While he was engaged in the game of arrow-shooting with the boys he
sent his arrow flying in the air and it went buzzing over the head of a bald-headed
man, then over a sore-eyed man and then over a lame man, passing over three ahupuaa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7142src" href="#xd32e7142">1</a> in its flight, until it dropped at the place where a young girl, by the name of Kawelu,
was living. When the arrow struck the ground, Kawelu was sitting outside the house,
so she ordered one of her attendants to bring the arrow to her; after she looked at
it she hid it.

<p>Hiku in his desire to find his arrow arrived at this place and asked of Kawelu if
she had seen his arrow which he thought had fallen somewhere near her. “No,” said
Kawelu. Hiku said: “I saw my arrow drop here.” “We have not seen your arrow,” replied
Kawelu. Hiku then said: “If I call for my arrow by its name it would make answer.”
“Please do so,” continued Kawelu. “Pua-ne, Pua-ne,” called out Hiku. “Yes,” answered
the arrow. “There you are, you two have hidden my arrow.” Kawelu then called out to
Hiku: “Come and get your arrow.” As Hiku reached for the arrow, Kawelu grabbed his
hand and pulled him into the house. As Hiku entered, Kawelu ordered her attendant
out, after which they plighted their vows. This was kept up for five days, when Hiku
became very hungry, for Kawelu went and took her meals by herself without asking Hiku.
On the sixth day, as Kawelu went out to the eating house to take some food, Hiku rose
and went up to his home at Kaumalumalu.

<p>When Kawelu came back after her meal she discovered that Hiku was not in the house,
so she went out to look for him; as she came out of the house she saw him climbing
the heights of Puukuakahi. Kawelu then started after him, calling her husband to come
back; but Hiku refused to come back saying: “I will not return, for I was made to
feel hungry in your house; go back.” When Kawelu reached the top of Puukuakahi, Hiku

who were desirous of seeing Kahalaopuna put to death, while on their way from Manoa

intended wife, Kahalaopuna! She went dancing two nights now, and on each night had
a separate lover.” When Kauhi heard this from these men, he said to himself: “I shall
indeed kill her for she has taken all the good things from my lord which I gave her.
She has now gone and defiled herself.”

Pohakea, a place above Ewa lying close to the Kaala mountain. While on their way,

with a cord by Kauhi and consequently her skirt (pa-u) became unfastened and trailed
on behind, she being unable to fasten it properly as her hands were bound.

river a small cloud appeared from the sea and came on up till it stood directly above
the Wailuku stream when it came down in the form of rain, flooding the whole country
and causing the stream to flow in a rush to the ocean, carrying Uweuwelekehau along
in its flood. This carrying away of Uweuwelekehau by the flood was caused by Kane
and Kanaloa. After he was thus carried out to sea some one went up and informed Ku
of the matter and he and his company returned home and a search was made, but the
boy could not be found. The parents then mourned for the boy.

<p>Early the next morning when Luukia awoke from her sleep she told her attendant, Papioholoholokahakai,
to go down and catch her some fish for breakfast, as there was none ready for her
morning meal. Papioholoholokahakai took up his net and proceeded to the beach. After
three casts of his net he found that he had caught nothing. Thinking that his charge
would get angry with him he again made another attempt, when to his delight he caught
a small stubby fish, and upon closer inspection he saw that it was a good fish. He
then took the fish and placed it into a calabash with some water and proceeded home.
When he arrived in the presence of Luukia, he handed her the calabash which contained
the fish. Luukia looked at the fish and was made glad by the shape of the fish and
took and gave it to her servants with the order that it be given good care.

comely and pleasant to look upon. Luukia called Uweuwelekehau to come closer, whereupon
they came together, though they did not know each other, for Kane and Kanaloa disapproved
of their living together at this time.

so he became very angry because of the promise he had made, that Luukia should have
no one else but Uweuwelekehau for her husband [not knowing that this very person was
the man of his choice]. Olopana then gathered all the people of Kauai and ordered
them to come before him to hear what he had to say about Luukia and her lover, and
to see for themselves who he was. As soon as the people came together in his presence,
he asked Luukia: “Which would you rather have, the husband or your father?” “I will
take my husband,” said Luukia. Olopana then ordered his chief officer: “Take off everything
from Luukia and leave her naked; also take off everything from her husband except
his malo.” Olopana thought they were deserving of this ill treatment because his daughter
had disobeyed him. Olopana then told the people of the whole of Kauai not to take
these two into their homes nor give them food or clothing. He also commanded that
they go to Mana and live, a place of spirits; no human beings lived there.

man and also that he was very powerful. In this chapter we will speak of his younger
brother Kalaehina.
</p>
<p>Before the death of Kalaepuni at Keanapou, on Kahoolawe, and while he was still king
of Hawaii in place of Keawenuiaumi, he ordered the people from one end of Kona to
the other to go with Kalaehina and haul down canoes at Kapua, a place in South Kona
next to Kau. In this expedition Kalaehina was placed in charge. There were as many
canoes as there were minor districts in Kona. When they arrived at the place where
the canoes were lying, there were six of them, there being six minor districts in
Kona, Kalaehina then said to the people: “Ye servants of my older brother, Kalaepuni,
hear me: the district that will get its canoe down to the shore first, its people
shall be the favorites of Kalaepuni.”

Therefore the people left the canoes where they were and returned to Kalaepuni. When
Kalaepuni saw the people he asked: “Where are the canoes?” Kalaehina replied: “We
hauled them until we could not get them past a certain place by a cliff and we have
left them there all stuck fast.” When Kalaepuni heard this he became very angry at
his younger brother and said to him: “Did I not put you over all the men? Why did
you not make them carry out my orders? You must therefore go and haul them down by
<span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>yourself. The rest of the people shall not go to assist you, and if you will not be

<p>When Kalaehina heard the command given him by his older brother he was much frightened,

the matter and all that night and the next day he spent in making plans as to how
to overcome this most difficult matter. After at last hitting on a plan he went up
to the place where the canoes were lying, took a look at them and proceeded to Kau.
When he arrived in Kau he deceived the people, saying: “Ye people of Kau, the king,
Kalaepuni has given me orders to tell you to go and haul the canoes down to the beach.”
When the people heard this they all started for Kapua. Upon arriving at the place,
the people lifted up the canoes, carried them to a place from where they could be
dragged to the beach and placed in the sea; five of them were then paddled to Keauhou,
where Kalaepuni was stopping, while Kalaehina followed behind with the other canoe
on his back, coming by the upper road to Kainaliu. When Kalaepuni saw this he praised

<p>The people of the place asked him: “Where are you going and where are you from?” He
replied: “I am from Kauai and am on a journey of sight seeing. I am going to Hana
and from there I will make a complete circuit of the island of Maui. After that I
shall return to Kauai.” The people then said: “What a great pity that such a good
looking man<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7817src" href="#xd32e7817">3</a> like you should be killed by our ill-tempered king Kalaehina. You had better return
home.” Kapakohana said: “Will he then get angry with a person who goes quietly along
the highway?” “Yes, he will get angry. He is the most violent tempered man and is
also very powerful. He has destroyed most all the chiefs and warriors on the island
and he pays homage to no one. Our king, Kamalalawalu, has escaped for fear of him.”
Kapakohana then questioned them further: “What has he done to show that he is powerful?”
“Here, he can pull up large trees by the roots, and he chops his firewood with his
head when the stewards act slow. On the king’s labor days the people are not allowed<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7820src" href="#xd32e7820">4</a> to talk for they all fear him. That’s it that you may know.” Kapakohana then replied:
“He is not so very strong then, seeing that his main strength is only in the pulling
up of trees. With a few blows from my fists he will run away.” The people with whom
he was staying said: “You will not have any chance against him for he is very strong.”
Kapakohana remarked: “I would be pleased to meet him in combat if he will say so.”

<p>Kalaehina then grabbed hold of Kapakohana and held him. Kapakohana also reached out
and held Kalaehina fast, this being Kapakohana’s favorite method [of fighting]. The
two then began to wrestle; first one would be on top and then the other would be on
top. This was kept up until Kapakohana was almost exhausted. While they were wrestling,
Kapakohana was at the same time studying how he could overcome his opponent; at last
he hit upon a plan, and that was to push his opponent to the cliff of Kaihalulu, at

came up with the dead body of Kalaehina. Kapakohana then proceeded to cut out the
lower jaw of Kalaehina and showed it to the people who were gathered at the beach.

of the kukui tree which grew close to the house. There he sat and listened to the
talk and the orders that were being given by Kapakohana, to make ready and set the

himself: “I am going to kill you all and eat you up, from the smallest to the largest

up and ran off swiftly with it. When Kanikaa saw Kapunohu run off with his spear he
gave chase<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7939src" href="#xd32e7939">4</a> with the idea of killing Kapunohu if he should catch him. In running away with the
spear, Kapunohu ran toward upper Kawaihae with Kanikaa hot after him. Upon coming
to an underground tunnel Kapunohu entered it with Kanikaa right along behind. Kapunohu
went out at the other end and soon after Kanikaa also went out. The chase was kept
up for some time till at last they agreed to make friends.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7942src" href="#xd32e7942">5</a> Because of this fact this place is to this day called Kaholeiwai, meaning, that it

<p>After this Kapunohu returned and lived with his sister, the wife of Kukuipahu, the
king of Kohala. On the morning after his return, while their morning meal was being
prepared, the sister told Kapunohu: “Go and take your morning meal with your <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>brother-in-law.” This was because the women were not allowed to eat with the men.

hands.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7954src" href="#xd32e7954">7</a> While he was doing this Kukuipahu asked: “After your hands are washed what are you

within the house from one end to the other, if anybody had called Kapunohu to come.
The people within the house all denied ever calling him. This was of course meant
for an insult and Kapunohu felt it deeply.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7957src" href="#xd32e7957">8</a> Kapunohu then went back to his sister and told her of his treatment. Shortly after

<p>After this display of his strength Kapunohu continued on his way up until he met two
old men who were farming along the highway. The land which they were cultivating is
known as Nahuluaina. Kapunohu then said to them: “Say, old men, I want you to each
take a flag and run with all your might away from each other and where you stop, that
shall be the boundary<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e7983src" href="#xd32e7983">12</a> of your lands.” The names of the old men were Pioholowai and Kukuikiikii. They each
took up a flag and ran with all their might. In their effort to cover as much ground
as possible, Pioholowai did not go very far before he became exhausted and so planted
his flag; because of this his land was short and the name of that land is Pioholowai
to this day, after his name. Kukuikiikii, on the other hand, ran and covered much
more ground before he planted his flag, consequently his land was much larger, and
the name of the land is Kukuikiikii to this day, after the old man who owned it. Because
of the mode of the division of these two lands all the following pieces of lands are
cut off short and do not run clear up to the mountains: Hualoa 1, Hualoa 2, Kealahewa
1, Kealahewa 2, Kealahewa 3, Hukiaa 1, Hukiaa 2, Kokoiki 1, Kokoiki 2, Puuepa 1, Puuepa

<p>In this battle Paopele, a great warrior, came out to meet Kapunohu; his war club,
Keolewa by name, had six rounds on it. It was so long that when it was stood up its
point would be wet with the mist in the heaven, and when laid down it would extend
over the whole length of an ahupuaa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8032src" href="#xd32e8032">18</a> from the sea to the mountain; when held up it would hide the sun and it could also
hold back the east wind. It required 4000 men<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8040src" href="#xd32e8040">19</a> to carry it. When this man came out on the battle field at Lamakee fear entered the
breast of Kapunohu, for the body of Paopele was very large and powerful; but his god
Kanikaa said: “Don’t be afraid of the loud-voiced thunder in the heaven for it has
no strength; you thrust him with your spear, Kanikawi, and I will bite him.” Soon
after this instruction was given by Kanikaa, he bit the back of Paopele. While Paopele
was considering the nature of this thing on his back, Kapunohu threw his spear at
Paopele, which hit him squarely, passed through him and killed him instantly. Lamakee
from that day to this became famous, for it was here that the great warrior Paopele
was killed by Kapunohu. The remnant of the army of Kukuipahu was again routed and
they retreated to Kaluawilinau, at Puuepa, and from there they retreated to Upolu,
then Puakea, then on to Kamilo and up to the place where the old men planted their
flags. Because of this fact the ahupuaa of Kukuipahu is one of the largest in the
district of Kohala to this day. The whole of Kohala thus came under the charge of
Niulii and he was acknowledged the king of the whole district.

<p>After the battle, Kapunohu and his god Kanikaa set out for Oahu, taking his spear
Kanikawi along with him, for a visit to his sister, the wife of Olopana. Kapunohu
went aboard of a canoe at Kohala and landed at Keanapou, in Kahoolawe, where he spent
the night; from this place he again set sail and landed at Kahalepalaoa in Lanai;
then from this last place he set out and landed at Kaluakoi in Molokai; then from
this place he again set out and landed at Makapuu Point, in Kailua, Koolau, where
his sister Konahuanui<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8045src" href="#xd32e8045">20</a> was living. When she saw Kapunohu they wept together, after which she said: “We have
no food ready. You must be hungry. There is food growing out there in the patches.
Your brother-in-law, Olopana is out with the men, working.” Kapunohu said to the sister:
“Let us go out so that you can show me the patches.” When they came to the place she
pointed out eight patches of large taro and returned home.

<p>Kapunohu then set to work and pulled up all the taro in the eight patches, tied the
taro into bundles and carried the whole lot in his two arms to the house, each arm
holding the taro of four patches. When Kapunohu arrived at the house with the taro
his sister looked on and said: “What an idea! I should think you would pull up but
one patch, but here you have pulled up all the patches.” Kapunohu replied: “This will
give us plenty of food; we will not be required to get it in small quantities.” Kapunohu
<span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>then picked up his spear, Kanikawi, broke off the point and started the fire. When
the fire lit, he took some of the taro and cut it up and threw the pieces into the
fire and in this way used the taro for firewood. Because of this action of Kapunohu,
the saying, “the hard taro of Waiahole,” is known from Hawaii to Niihau.
</p>
<p>When Olopana saw what Kapunohu had done, he began to scheme, that with the use of
Kapunohu he would be able to conquer the whole of Oahu, as he and Kakuhihewa, the
king of the Kona side of Oahu, were on bad terms. Through the advice of his priest,
Olopana was made doubly sure that Kapunohu was a very strong and brave man and was
fearless and willing to meet all comers. Therefore Olopana made Kapunohu the commander-in-chief
of his forces and urged upon him to go and fight Kakuhihewa. In this battle Kakuhihewa
was slain by Kapunohu and the whole of Oahu came under the rule of Olopana.

<p>After the death of Olopana, Kapunohu left Oahu and journeyed to Kauai. Boarding his
canoe he set sail and first landed at Poki, in Waimea; from this place he continued
on to Wahiawa and then on to Lawai in Koloa where he settled down. There lived at
this place a great warrior, by the name of Kemamo, who was noted for his great strength
and skill in the use of the sling; he was without equal in its practice; his left
hand was considered better than his right, and he could throw a stone for a distance
of six miles and in the seventh mile its force ceased. No person in Kauai was found
who could face him, not from amongst the chiefs or soldiers. Because of this man people
were afraid to travel between Koloa and Nawiliwili; those on the Koolau side could
not pass over to Nawiliwili and those from the Kona side were afraid to travel toward
the Koloa side, for the reason that Kemamo and his wife Waialeale<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8056src" href="#xd32e8056">21</a> lived between Koloa and Nawiliwili.

<p>When Kapunohu arrived at Lawai he was entertained that night by some of the people
of the place, and on the next day he prepared to continue on his journey. When he
was ready to start, the people said: “You must not go by this way or you will get
killed by our great warrior.” Kapunohu then asked: “Who is this warrior?” “Kemamo.”
“In what is his strength?” “He is very skilful in the use of the sling. He never misses
a shot, and the strength of his flying stone will go over five miles. Therefore you
must not go for you will get killed.” Kapunohu said: “Then he is not strong. The sling
is only a plaything for the boys of our place and it is not considered of any consequence.”
These remarks made by Kapunohu were carried around until they reached Kemamo; so Kemamo
made the remark: “Yes, this is the first time that my strength in the use of the sling
has been denied. Well and good; if he desires to come and test as which of us is the
stronger, let him come on.” When Kapunohu heard this, he went out to meet Kemamo.
Upon seeing Kapunohu, Kemamo asked: “Are you the man that has said that I have no
strength in the use of the sling?” Kapunohu replied: “Yes, I am the man. It is because
these people said that you are very skilful in the use of the sling, so I said, that
it is the plaything with the small boys at our place.”

takes with him. If you beat me my life shall be forfeited, and if I should beat you
your life shall be forfeited.” Kemamo agreed to this and the bet was declared made.
Kemamo then said: “The course over which we shall compete in throwing the stone with
the sling, shall be from Koloa to Moloaa in Koolau. We must make our throws over these
points and toward Moloaa; whoever throws the greatest distance beyond Moloaa wins.”
Kapunohu replied: “Yes, I will agree to that, but I am going to use my spear while
you use your sling.” Kemamo agreed to this. Kemamo then asked: “Who shall take the
first chance? Shall it be the stranger, or shall it be the native son?” Kapunohu answered:

<p>Kemamo then took up his sling and threw his stone, which went six miles and over,
and it only fell and rolled after it had entered into the seventh mile, stopping at
Anahola, where it was picked up by the best runner of Kauai, a man by the name of
Kawaikuauhoe. Kapunohu then threw his spear, darting along from Koloa and over Niumalu,
and as it shielded the sun from the coconut trees at this place the land was given
the name of Niumalu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8067src" href="#xd32e8067">22</a> as known to this day; then it went on and into the water in upper Wailua, giving
the place the name of Kawelowai as well as the land next to it which is called Waiehu;

a ridge at Anahola, which is called <span class="sic" title="Suggested correction: Kalalea">Kalaea</span>, leaving a hole through it, which can be seen to this day; from this place it went
on past Moloaa, then past Waiakalua, then into Kalihikai, where it grew weaker and

<p>Concerning Kamalalawalu: she was the daughter of Hanakaulua and Haehae of Kapoho,
Puna, Hawaii. The parents of Kamalalawalu were chiefs of the land of Kapoho. She was
a very beautiful woman to behold, far superior to all the women of Puna and Hilo,
a virgin, brought up under very strict kapu; no person was allowed to see her and
she had no companion other than her own brother, Kumukahi. These two had eight hundred

of your death?” Halemano replied: “It is because of a woman. This is the manner of
her appearance [in my dreams]: she is very beautiful; her eyes and body are perfect;
she has long, straight, black hair; is tall, dignified, and seems to be of very high
rank like a chiefess.” Laenihi again asked him: “What is the nature of her outward
dress?” “Her dress seems to be scented with <i lang="haw">pele</i> and <i lang="haw">mahuna</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e8812src" href="#xd32e8812">6</a> of Kauai, and her pa-u is made of some very light material dyed red. She wears a

If it is Kamalalawalu, the woman I heard so much of while in Puna, then she must be
very beautiful indeed.” Laenihi then again asked: “How do you meet her?” Halemano
replied: “When I fall asleep we meet very soon after, and you could hear us talk if
you should listen; even now you could hear us if I fall asleep.” Laenihi then said:
“Yes, you may go to sleep now. If you should meet your lover, ask her to give you

the wind from the sea to blow, called the <i lang="haw">unuloa</i>, which caused the sea to be aroused from its calm repose and the surf off Kaimu began
to roll in. It is here that the people at all times go in surf riding. Early that

at this time of writing. We must, however, look into the story and see if it is true
or not. In this legend, it is said, that it was at the land of Kahikihonuakele,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e9992src" href="#xd32e9992">2</a> down in the bottom of the deep ocean, where it lies to this day, that the heroine

When Kipapalauulu came before his father, he asked him: “Say, why did you fail to

I did not accompany her while bathing because there were always a lot of servants
who attended to her, so I concluded this time not to go out with her.” The father
then said: “Because you have failed in this I am going to send you away from my presence.

his grandfather broke open the ocean and a crack was made from the floor of the ocean

poles, the sacred places of worship, the kapu insignia and all the different sacred
things. Because of these doings of Maikoha, the father, Konikonia, became very angry.
He was not sure which one had done this unholy thing, so he pondered deeply on how
he was to find out the guilty person. After spending several days in study he decided
on a certain course as follows: he procured two long poles and tied one of them on
the back of the necks of all his ten children and the other he tied under the chin.
He thought within himself that the one who would not cry would be the guilty one,
a sure proof he thought, and he must be sent away. In applying this test, Maikoha
was the one who did not cry out, all the other children cried more or less. This satisfied
the father that Maikoha was the guilty one and so he was sent away, to go wherever
he pleased.

<p class="first">Namakaokapaoo was a very brave little boy, and very strong for his young years. He
had no compeer in these Islands from Hawaii to Niihau, according to his size for bravery.
His father was Kauluakahai of Kahikipapaialewa,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10197src" href="#xd32e10197">1</a> a land in great Kahiki. Pokai was his mother. His father was a great chief and had
a godly relationship. Hoaeae, in Ewa, was the place where they met as man and wife
and begat Namakaokapaoo. When Pokai was <span class="corr" id="xd32e10200" title="Source: enciente">enceinte</span> of Namakaokapaoo, Kauluakahai went back to his own land, leaving Pokai in that condition
until childbirth.
</p>
<p>When the child was born Pokai and her child Namakaokapaoo were quite destitute, and
while they were in that condition of life a good man named Pualii came from Lihue<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10205src" href="#xd32e10205">2</a> to fish at Honouliuli. He turned in at the home of Pokai. He looked at her and had
a yearning for her. He said: “I desire you to be my wife.” Pokai returned: “How could
you have a desire for me, seeing that I have already given birth to a child, and my
body is defiled?” Pualii answered: “There’s nothing in those things if you desire
our union.” Pokai then assented and went with her husband Pualii, and resided at the
plans of Keahumoa.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10208src" href="#xd32e10208">3</a> (Kula-o-Keahumoa.)
</p>
<p>They lived there tilling the soil. Pualii had two large potato patches which remain
to this day; they are called Namakaokapaoo.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10213src" href="#xd32e10213">4</a> When the potatoes were ripe Pualii made a vow that when the head<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10219src" href="#xd32e10219">5</a> of an <i lang="haw">ulua</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10224src" href="#xd32e10224">6</a> fish and the potatoes were roasted, and Pualii had first eaten thereof, then the
potatoes would be free, and that his wife and others could eat thereof. Therefore
Pualii went down to Honouliuli to catch the fish to be eaten together with the potato.

<p>When Pualii was gone Namakaokapaoo, with seventeen other youngsters, went to Pualii’s
potato patches. Namakaokapaoo was only a very small child then, standing two and a
half feet high, had not eaten adult food. He had not worn a girdle (malo), and was
yet in a state of nudity.
</p>
<p>When they arrived at the potato patches he told the boys to dig up the potatoes and
pull up all the vines, and allow nothing to stand in the patches. But the boys were
afraid and only dug up the potatoes without pulling up the vines. Namakaokapaoo then
started to pull up everything from both patches until the vines were piled up high
in <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>stacks. There were forty such stacks from the two fields. He thereafter started a
fire and roasted thereon four clusters of potatoes.
</p>
<p>While he was cooking his potatoes his stepfather came home and asked his mother Pokai:
“Did you send your child to pull up my potatoes?” Pokai said: “No.” Pualii then said:
“Well, this day his head and eyes<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10238src" href="#xd32e10238">7</a> will be meat for my potato meal. This day he shall die at my hands.” He seized an
axe and went out to the field where he found Namakaokapaoo roasting his four clusters
of potatoes in the fire. All the other boys ran off and stood at a distance for fear
of Pualii.
</p>
<p>Pualii then said to Namakaokapaoo: “Say, I have in my hand an axe with which to cut
off your head this day, and when your head is off it will be roasted with potatoes
so that I may eat first and then it (the potato) will be free.” Namakaokapaoo paid
no attention to these words of Pualii, who repeated them after an interval. And while
Pualii was about to cut Namakaokapaoo with the axe, the latter just then delivered
his death prayer against Pualii. The prayer follows:

<p>At the time that Namakaokapaoo ended his prayer, Pualii struck at Namakaokapaoo with
the axe, but the sharp edge of the axe turned on himself cutting off and throwing
his head some distance, from whence it said: “Farewell to thee, Namakaokapaoo.”
</p>
<p>Namakaokapaoo picked up Pualii’s head and threw it towards Waipouli, a cave situated
on the beach at Honouliuli (a distance of about five miles).<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10266src" href="#xd32e10266">9</a> After Pualii’s death Namakaokapaoo went back to his mother. He did not eat any food.
</p>
<p>At that time Amau, a king of Oahu, was residing at Waikiki. A certain man of Honouliuli
came to Waikiki, to where the king was stopping, and said to him: “Your majesty, there
is a very strong little boy, who killed his stepfather and threw his (father’s) head
a very long distance, about five miles.”
</p>
<p>When Amau heard this he said: “He is indeed strong if he kills me; but if he does
not kill me he is not strong.” While he was talking at Waikiki, Namakaokapaoo heard
<span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>all of this talk about himself. He then took and hid his mother in the cave at Waipouli,
after which he came back to their house at Keahumoa. He went up on the roof of the
house and parted the front and rear thatchings on the ridge and slept there.
</p>
<p>Amau the king sent four companies of men, each company consisting of forty-eight men.
When they arrived at Keahumoa they entered the house and found no person in it. And
when they were preparing to leave Namakaokapaoo called to them from the ridge. When
they heard the voice without seeing anybody, they asked: “Where are you talking from?”
Namakaokapaoo answered: “I am up here.” Eight men climbed up on the roof, four from
the rear and four from the front, and found Namakaokapaoo. He asked them: “What do
you want here?” And they said: “We have come to fight Namakaokapaoo, a small boy just
like you, who is very strong and brave, and who killed his father Pualii.” He answered
and said: “I know; Namakaokapaoo is quite a big man. He has gone to Koolau. I am his
namesake.” And they said to him: “No, no, you are the one, so we heard; therefore
we will kill you; you shall not live.”
</p>
<p>Namakaokapaoo then said: “Let us go down and fight it out then.” As soon as they were
on the ground Namakaokapaoo made a clean sweep, killing them all excepting one man,
who ran and met Amau at Waikiki, and reported their total annihilation with the exception
of himself.

<p>Namakaokapaoo wandered about until he met eight boys, who were playing at arrow shooting.
They were big boys and quite proficient in the sport. Namakaokapaoo asked them: “Are
you skilful in arrow shooting?” They replied: “Yes.” He again asked: “How can you
show your cleverness?” “Oh, an arrow can go quite a distance inland then drop, and
sometimes nearly the whole length of a division of land” (ahupuaa). Namakaokapaoo
then said: “That is not cleverness; neither is the arrow a long distance flyer. A
good flyer would flit to the boundary of this division of land, then shake itself
and continue on for four divisions; then it is named by the parent’s appellation.

it over and finally said: “Your arrow is a <i lang="haw">lehua</i>, a lehua which stands in the dung-hill. It is not a flyer. It will only dip because
of the weight at the head.” At these words the boys became very much infuriated and
asked him to make a wager. Namakaokapaoo agreed. The boys put up five canoe houses

that I would be devoid of all my possessions and all Hawaii would belong to Ku. There
are with Ku two very brave and very strong men. One, who is Kahuaai, is a very powerful

<p class="first">The scene of this legend is laid in Keaau, Puna, in which part of the country there
once lived a man by the name of Keaau, who owned two <i lang="haw">leho</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10457src" href="#xd32e10457">1</a> shells (cowries) called Kalokuna. Whenever the possessor of these shells went out
squid fishing all that was necessary to do was to take and expose them and the squids
would come up and enter the canoe. This was Keaau’s regular occupation every day.
The existence of these extraordinary shells was in time carried to Umi, who was then
living in Kona. Whereupon he ordered his messengers to go to the home of Keaau and
obtain possession of them, and at their demand<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10460src" href="#xd32e10460">2</a> the shells were given up and the messengers returned with them to the king.

<p>After the shells were secured by Umi, a deep yearning sprang up in the breast of Keaau
for them. After studying for a time for means of recovering the shells, he one day
prepared his canoe for sea, procured a pig, some awa and ouholowai<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10465src" href="#xd32e10465">3</a> and eleuli, kapas of Olaa. The kapas he put into a calabash and then the pig, the
awa and the calabash were placed into the canoe, which he then boarded and set out
on a journey around Hawaii in search of some one who could steal back his shells from
Umi.

he met the same disappointment. He found men good in the art of stealing, but none
smart enough to recover his shells. He next set out for Lanai and traveled around
that island, but he met the same fate. He then set out for Molokai and journeyed around
it till, off the point of Kalaeokalaau, he met a man of that island who was out fishing.
The man upon seeing him called out, saying: “Where is your canoe sailing for?” Keaau
replied: “I am in search of a person who can steal back my leho shells from Umi. I
have here with me <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>in my canoe several valuable things which I shall give as presents to the thief who

you come to Makapuu and after you have passed that place steer your canoe for a point
between the bird islands and Mokapu. When you reach that point look for the cliff
which resembles the roof of a house, above, and directly below the cliff you will
see a grove of Kukui trees; there you will find Iwa, the thieving son of Kukui.”

<p>After receiving these instructions, Keaau set out, and after he had sailed past the
different points he came to the landing below the home of Iwa. Upon touching land
he looked about him and saw a small boy without his loin cloth running along the beach.
Keaau then called out to him: “Is your name Iwa?” The boy replied: “No, Iwa is at
the house.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10493src" href="#xd32e10493">5</a> When Keaau arrived at the house he found Kukui, the father of Iwa. Keaau then asked

him your pig.” When Keaau heard this, he returned and said to Iwa: “There, you are
Iwa after all; you misdirected me.” Keaau then took the pig and presented it to Iwa
saying: “Here, I present this to Iwa, the thieving son of Kukui, together with the
articles of value in my canoe and the canoe itself.” Iwa then said to Keaau: “Let
us return to the house.” When they arrived at the house, the pig was killed and put
into the oven, and the awa was prepared. After the meal was over, Iwa turned and asked
of Keaau: “What is the object of your journey that has brought you here?” Keaau replied:
“I had two shells which were taken away from me by orders from the king, Umi, and
he has them in his possession now. I value these shells so much that I am distracted,
and that is the reason of my being present here.” “We must await until tomorrow morning,”

<p>They retired for the night, and on daylight the next day they boarded the canoe and
set out to sea. Iwa took the stern of the canoe with his paddle called Kapahi, while
Keaau took the seat at the bow. After they were seated in the canoe, Iwa called out:
“Kapahi, take Iwa out to sea,” at the same time he dipped his paddle into the sea.
(This meant that one stroke of the paddle was all that was needed.) With this one
stroke, they passed between Niihau and Kauai. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “This
is not Hawaii, these islands are Kauai and Niihau.” Iwa then turned the stern of the
canoe around and again called out to his paddle, Kapahi: “Kapahi, take Iwa out to
sea.” When Iwa drew his paddle out of the sea they were passing outside of Kawaihoa.
He then asked of Keaau: “Have we arrived at Hawaii?” “No,” said Keaau. Again Iwa took
up his paddle and gave one stroke and they left Molokai and Lanai to their rear and
they went floating between the island of Molokini and Pohakueaea, a point of land
looking <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>toward Hawaii. Iwa then asked: “Have we arrived?” “Yes,” replied Keaau, “but it is
at that point of land where the cloud hangs over the mountain that we want to go;
it is to the west of that point that Umi is now living.” Iwa then took up his paddle,
Kapahi, and gave one stroke and they arrived outside of Kalaeakeahole, a point of
land looking towards Kailua, where Umi had his residence. When they looked about them,
they saw Umi just below them, in his canoe. Iwa then said to Keaau: “There is Umi
in his canoe with the shells. Let us get our canoe to the rear and out of sight of
Umi.” When they were some distance from Umi, Iwa said: “Say, Keaau, you must float
right at this spot until I return with your shells.” Keaau therefore kept his canoe
floating on the same spot while Iwa dove down and swam until he had reached the bottom
of the ocean, then walked under water to the place where the canoe of Umi was floating,
then swam up until he was almost up to the surface; and as the shells were being let
down on the side of the canoe, Iwa grabbed them and took them down with him to a large
coral, there he fastened the fish-line, then he took the shells and swam under water
until he reached their canoe and got into it. The two then returned and landed at
Leleiwi, in Hilo, where they made their home. Upon the recovery of his shells Keaau
again took up his favorite occupation, that of squid fishing, taking along his shells,
Kalokuna. The squids at sight of the shells climbed and entered the canoe until it
was loaded down when they returned to shore.

<p>After the shells were taken by Iwa and the line fastened to a coral, Umi after a time
pulled up on his line, but to his surprise it would not yield and thinking that the
line was entangled to the coral he did not wish to pull very strong, thinking the
line would break and he would lose the shells. Fearing he would lose them he remained
in his canoe all day, and that night he slept out at sea with his men, and for some
days he lived there, while his men dove down to untangle the fish-line and thus recover
the much valued shells. Men noted for being able to stay under water a long time were
sent for, and these men were told to go down, but the best they could do was to go
down three times forty fathoms, seven hundred and twenty feet,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10504src" href="#xd32e10504">6</a> not deep enough to reach the bottom where the line was tangled. This was kept up
for a week. Umi then sent out his runners to make a circuit of Hawaii to look for
a man who could stay under water long enough to recover the shells. In this trip around
the island of Hawaii, Iwa was found at Leleiwi, the point of land adjoining Kumukahi,
between Puna and Hilo. When Iwa heard the king’s wish through his runner, Iwa said
to him: “There are no shells at the end of the line. The line only is fastened to
some coral in the bottom of the ocean. The shells have been recovered by Keaau.” When
the runner heard this he returned to Umi taking Iwa with him and told Umi of what
he had heard from Iwa. Umi then asked Iwa regarding the shells and Iwa told Umi just
what the runner had told him. At the close of the report Umi asked Iwa: “Can you get
these shells for me if you should go for them?” Iwa replied: “Yes,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10507src" href="#xd32e10507">7</a> Iwa then journeyed back to the home of Keaau in Leleiwi.

you never would be able to get it; but here you have gotten it. You are smart.” After

six best thieves. There are two houses to be filled in one night, one for you and
one for them. If you will not be able to fill yours first, you will be killed; so

<p>There are six districts in the island of Hawaii and Umi had six expert thieves.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10552src" href="#xd32e10552">12</a> While it was still daylight the six thieves went out to see what things they could
steal; and when it became dark they began to steal and to carry everything they could
lay their hands on into their house. This was kept up until the first cock crow, when
there was very little room left in the house. At about this same time Iwa woke up
and as soon as the six men went to sleep he proceeded to steal the things stolen by
them of Umi’s men, men, women, children, canoes, animals and various other things.
Before he could remove all the things into his house there was no space left, so he
had to leave some of them. When it was daylight the next day they found that the house
belonging to the six men was almost empty, while Iwa’s house was filled with the different
things. The six men were therefore declared beaten and were killed<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10555src" href="#xd32e10555">13</a> in place of Iwa.

Kaialeale is still asleep. If he is I can dive down and come up at that point over
yonder where I will get two lobsters, and my mother and I will have something to eat
with our potatoes in the uplands.” While Punia was talking to Kaialeale the rest of
the sharks woke up. Kaialeale then said to the other sharks: “Let us watch and see
where Punia dives, then we will dive in after him.” Punia had a stone in his hand
while he was talking which he threw out beyond the point where he spoke about diving
to get the lobsters. When the stone struck the water the sharks made a dive for the
place leaving the cave of lobsters unguarded. Punia then dove down and secured two
lobsters and then addressed the sharks: “Here there, Punia has gone down and he has
two lobsters, giving him something to live on. This will keep my mother and myself
alive. It was the first shark, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth,
the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, it was the eleventh shark that told
me what to do, the one with the thin tail. He was the one that told me what to do.”

get in a row. He then proceeded to count them, and sure <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>enough there were ten of them, then he looked for the one with the thin tail. When
he found the one he said: “So it was you that told Punia what to do. You shall die.”

kind.” After this Punia returned home to his mother.

<p>Punia thus continued deceiving the sharks until all were killed except Kaialeale.
After this Punia hewed out two sticks each a yard long; he next procured the two necessary
sticks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10645src" href="#xd32e10645">3</a> a hard and a soft one, to make fire; then he procured some charcoal and kindling
wood; then he prepared some food, salt, an opihi<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10657src" href="#xd32e10657">4</a> shell and put all these things into a bag. With this [bag] Punia proceeded to the
beach and when he got directly over the cave, where Kaialeale was sleeping, he called
out: “If when I dive down Kaialeale should bite me and I die and my blood should come
to the surface, then my mother will see it and I shall come to life again. But if
when I dive, Kaialeale should open wide his mouth so that I am swallowed whole, I
shall die and will never be able to come to life again.” While Punia was talking,
Kaialeale was listening, and he said to himself: “I will not bite you for you might
come to life again. I shall open my mouth wide enough for you to walk in. So this
is the time when I shall kill you. Yes, you shall die; nothing will save you.” Punia
then dove down with his bag, when Kaialeale opened his mouth and Punia walked in.
As soon as Punia got into the mouth it tried to close up, but Punia took the two sticks
he had hewed out and stood them up which kept the mouth open. He then rubbed the two
sticks and when the fire was started he placed on the coals; he next took out his
opihi shell and began to scrape the inside of the shark and after he had a ball of
meat he proceeded to cook it and when cooked he sat down and with his potatoes he
made his meal, while the shark was swimming here and there through the ocean. This
scraping hurt the shark so much that he could not keep still; he was forced to go
here and there. Punia was carried around in the shark for about ten days, when at
last the shark began to grow weak and it made its way back toward <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>land, arriving outside of Kona, at a place called Alula, directly out of Hiiakanoholae.

<p>After Punia got out of the shark he proceeded on his way and saw several ghosts with
nets all busy tying on stones for sinkers to the bottom of the nets; this place was
near the beach. At sight of the ghosts he placed his hands at his back and began wailing
and recounting in a chant the different places where he used to go fishing with his
father. In this Punia was trying to deceive the ghosts in order to save himself.

<p class="first">When Punia ceased wailing, one of the ghosts said to another: “Our nets will be of
some use now since here comes a man who is acquainted with this place and we will
not be letting down our nets in the wrong place.” They then called out [to Punia]:
“Come here.” When Punia heard this call he went up to the ghosts. They then asked
him: “What are you crying about?” Punia replied: “I am crying because of my father;
this is the place where we used to fish. When I saw the lava rocks, I thought of him.”
The ghosts then said to Punia: “Well and good, you shall show us how and where to
cast the nets and we will work under you.” Punia assented to this saying: “All right,
if you carry out my instructions and do as I tell you we will catch all the fish you
want. This is what I want you to do: Two of you must swim out with me while the rest
shall stay ashore here; and when I call to some of you to swim out to us then come.
When I stick up two fingers, that will mean that I want two to come; and if I stick
up one finger, then I want one to come. That is the way the fish of this place are
caught, because the bottom is all open and there are several places where the nets
must be let down.” The ghosts all heard the instructions of Punia. Punia after this
swam out with two of the ghosts, and after some little time he called out to the two
ghosts to open out the nets and said: “When I give you the order to dive, then you
must dive down and don’t come up again until I pull on the nets, for I see there is
a large school of them here.” When the ghosts dove down Punia dove in after them and
twisted the nets tangling up the ghosts and killing them. After these two were killed
Punia came up to the surface and called out to those ashore holding up two fingers.
Two more came swimming and again they were killed. He next called out and held up
one finger and that one was also killed. Punia continued this deceit until there were
but very few of the ghosts left alive. When the ghosts saw that Punia was the only
one to be seen in the sea they called out to Punia: “Where are the rest of our companions?”
“They are here,” replied Punia. “They are twisting up the kala, the uhu, the nenue,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10732src" href="#xd32e10732">9</a> the palani and the transient fish of these waters.” The ghosts that were left then
said one to another: “They are not killed.” Punia then held up one finger, calling
for only one. One came out. Punia called for two and two swam out. Punia continued
to do this until all but one of the ghosts were killed.

<p>The reputation of Pamano as a singer and a chanter, after a time, spread over the
land of his birth and at last it reached Koolau,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10827src" href="#xd32e10827">2</a> in the uplands of Mokulau, located in the middle of Kaupo. When Pamano arrived at
that place he was seen by Kaiuli, the king of Maui, and Pamano being a handsome fellow,
he was adopted by the king as a son,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10830src" href="#xd32e10830">3</a> and in this way he became known as the brother of Keaka, the only daughter of Kaiuli.
By being adopted Pamano was virtually made king of Maui. The first command given Pamano
by Kaiuli was this: After calling for Pamano and his daughter Keaka to come to him,
he said: “Where are you, my two children? I want you to listen to what I have to say.
I want you, Pamano, to be good and not to touch your sister; and I want you, Keaka,
to be good and not to touch your brother. If you two wish to go surf riding, each
of you can go down and have your surf riding and then return straight home. Pamano
must not enter the house of Keaka or you will die; and so with Keaka.”

<p>It was Pamano’s custom to go down surf riding at Mokulau every day. Keaka on the other
hand had moved to Mokulau and she was at this time living there with her guardian,
a man by the name of Koolau, a close friend of Pamano’s. In these daily trips down
to enjoy the surf something happened one day which led to difficulties. This day,
after Pamano and Koolau had finished bathing, they started on their return, and while
on their way, in passing by the house of Keaka, she called out to them: “Come and
get some fish for you two.” Upon hearing the call the two stood and looked at her.
Keaka continued calling and beckoning them to come to her. The two therefore approached
the wall surrounding the house and called out to Keaka: “Give us our fish.” She replied:
“The fish have no legs. You two who have legs must come and get the fish yourselves.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span>The two then entered the yard. Keaka, however, went into the house and held up the
fish, at the same time calling for one of them to come in and get them. The two stood
there hesitating, not knowing what to do. She called again, whereupon Pamano reached
and seized the fish, but Keaka jumped and held Pamano and then closed the door and
fastened it. Koolau stood on the outside at the end of the house.

<p>Long before this Keaka had a longing desire to make advances on Pamano, for she was
in love with him and, too, she thought that he would make her a good husband; besides,
he was such a handsome fellow. At last her chance came and all her hopes were realized.
At first they argued,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10839src" href="#xd32e10839">4</a> but did not lie together, for Pamano said to Keaka: “I have vowed with Koolau that
before I take a wife he must first have her; and this promise also holds good with
him; before he takes a wife, I must first be favored; therefore we must call him in

<p class="first">Pamano then made reply: “You know, it was Keaka. After you came away we passed the
evening together.” At the reply Koolau arose and went up to inform Kaiuli thereof.
While he was on his way up, however, Kaiuli looked at him but was unable to recognize
him; so he turned to his companions and asked: “Who is that coming up here?” Some
one replied: “It is Koolau.” “No, that is some one else,” said another. This was kept
up until Koolau was almost up to them, when their doubts were entirely removed, for
they could plainly see that it was he. As he stood in their presence, Kaiuli asked
him: “What has brought you up here so early?” “Yes, I came early because I have something
to say. The chief and chiefess who live in the lowlands have sinned.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10881src" href="#xd32e10881">6</a> Pamano has gone and slept with Keaka. That is the reason why I came up, that you
should hear.” Kaiuli then asked of Waipu: “How about your nephew? Shall he live or
die?” Waipu replied: “He shall die.” “What fault have you to cause his death?” asked
Kaiuli. “There is a fault. When he becomes king of Maui, and the bundles of kapued
kapas and loin cloth are brought out, I will get the covering for my kapa and the
binding will be my loin cloth.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10884src" href="#xd32e10884">7</a> Therefore he shall die.” Kaiuli then asked him: “By what means shall he be killed?”
“By the use of the awa,” replied Waipu, “for he is very fond of awa.” The preparations
of the awa were then commenced. The calabashes were filled, the water gourds were
filled, the fish calabashes were filled, and when all the awa was prepared Kaiuli
asked of Waipu: “Who will go and bring Pamano?” “I will,” said Waipu.

violent dispute between the prophet and some of the people he procured an ape leaf
and spread it out on the roadway and said to the people: “If after I spread the ape
leaf on the road and he should step on it and does not tear it then the body is that
of a ghost; but if it tears, then he has a human body.” In all this Pamano was aware
of the test. After spreading out the ape leaf the prophet said to the people: “Now
watch him.” Pamano upon coming to the ape leaf<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e10992src" href="#xd32e10992">15</a> stepped on it and rubbed it with his feet tearing the leaf. When the people saw that

to deceive them. After this the prophet followed Pamano. When the sisters of Pamano

<p>Some time after this the two were to have a kilu night; so people from all parts began
to come to the royal dancing hall to witness the kilu games of the chiefs.
</p>
<p>Upon the approach of the night when the kilu was to take place, Pamano and several
others came to the dancing hall. Pamano on getting into the hall went and sat within
the cloak of a man who had on a very large cloak or wrapper, and there he hid himself.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11001src" href="#xd32e11001">16</a>
</p>
<p>When the time for the commencement of the game approached Keaka came out and chanted
the very meles composed and sung by Pamano. Then followed a recess. Pamano after awhile
chanted from within his hiding place, the chants recited by him to Koolau while he
and Keaka were in the house. While Pamano was chanting, Keaka began to make a search
for the chanter, weeping at the same time, for she was aware that none knew these
chants save Pamano and herself. After a time she found him. Pamano then said to her:
“I will never be your husband as long as Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau are alive. After
they are dead I will live with you.” When Keaka heard this she ordered some men to
start an oven; and after it was heated, the three, Kaiuli, Waipu and Koolau were all
killed and put into the oven. After this Pamano took Keaka to be his wife.

When the men and Kamapuaa arrived at Pahoa [and Olopana had departed for home], the
men sought instruments with which to cut the pig [Kamapuaa] open, and let the insides
be taken out so as to make the carrying much easier. Lonoaohi knew that if Kamapuaa

of this day and night until tomorrow; by that time the sacrifice of the king will
surely get spoiled. Furthermore, the king has said, that the hog must not be dragged,

that you were dead, but I see that you are not. These bones will now be cared for.”
After a while he again said to Kamapuaa: “Say, I want the wai lands of Oahu.” Kamapuaa
answered: “Hu.” The meaning of the request was this: that Lonoaohi was to get the
lands containing the word or letters w-a-i, such as, Waianae, Waialua and so on. Lonoaohi
was aware, through his great powers, that Olopana was to be killed in the contest
that was yet to come, and that Kamapuaa would come in possession of Oahu. This was
the reason he made this request. After this meeting between Lonoaohi and Kamapuaa,

striking until they were made dull; furthermore, after a time the foreheads were unable

<p class="first">Pele made reply: “Yes, that would have been all right, had you come in peace, then
I would have treated you peaceably; but since you have come otherwise, it is only
by strength that you can get Pele.” Pele then ordered Lonomakua to keep up with the
fire; she also ordered the Hiiakas, the Kahoaliis, her uncles and all the gods to
keep the fire going. Molten rocks then flew up to heaven; the heaven was as though
in flames; the sun looked red and the sky was cloudless. The heat from the fire reached
the breast of Kamapuaa and his whole body was encompassed by the fire of Pele; but
Kamapuaa was surrounded by his gods, <span class="corr" id="xd32e11884" title="Source: Kuiliaikekaua">Kuliaikekaua</span> and others, so he was protected and was not consumed by the fire of Pele. The sun
was, however, darkened by the smoke of the woman, and Kilauea was entirely lost from

<p>When at last Pele looked, there stood Kamapuaa on Akanikolea, still alive. Again Pele
ordered that the fire be rekindled. As soon as Kamapuaa saw the fire was again burning,
he called out for his sister, Keliiomakahanaloa, who came up in the form of a small
cloud from the south, and when it was directly over the pit of Kilauea, a heavy rain
fell which filled the pit until it overflowed, putting out the fire of Pele; and the
only things that were saved were the fire making sticks. The hog forms of Kama<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11892src" href="#xd32e11892">64</a> then descended into the pit of Kilauea until the whole place was overrun with hogs.
Kamapuaa then changed himself into the form of a hog, opened wide its mouth, showing
its tusks, and swallowed Halemaumau, taking in Pele, her sisters and brothers, and
they were kept within his stomach until Pele and the others were almost dead. But
when Lonoikiawewaealoha, the fickle god, the love making and unstable god, saw this
he put compassion in the heart of Kamapuaa and his gods and Pele and the others were
saved, otherwise Pele would have been killed. Shortly after this, Kamapuaa left Halemaumau,
whereupon Pele ordered Lonomakua to again start the fire. Lonomakua then took up the
two pieces of wood and began rubbing them together<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e11895src" href="#xd32e11895">65</a> and in time the fire was started and the kindling wood was put on, and after a while
the pit of Kilauea was again filled. The fire came up until it reached Kamapuaa, who
was standing on Akanikolea. He then called for his different supernatural bodies,
such as the trees, <i lang="haw">olomea</i>, <i lang="haw">hala</i>, the <i lang="haw">uhaloa</i> and <i lang="haw">amaumau</i>, and these different things began to grow, shutting off the fire. This battle was
maintained for some time, no one gaining a single advantage. After the battle had
been maintained for some days Pele and Kamapuaa lived as husband and wife. During
this union the two made a compact, dividing Hawaii into two parts; Pele taking three
districts, Puna, Kau and Kona, the districts having the most lava rocks; while Kohala,
Hamakua and Hilo went to Kamapuaa; these districts being the ones free of rocks. This
ended the war between the two.

Maui; then to Molokai and from there to Oahu. After a short stay in Oahu he continued
his journey to Kauai and landed at Kipu. On his way inland he met Limaloa who was
proceeding to the home of Kaneiki, a chief and ruler of one of the districts of Kauai,
he having in charge several of the ahupuaas of that island. The reason of Limaloa’s
visit to the home of Kaneiki was to court his two daughters. In this journey Kamapuaa
had changed himself back to his human form, handsome and pleasant to look upon. Therefore
Limaloa adopted him in reciprocal friendship. While on their way Limaloa said to Kamapuaa:
“With your efforts I shall win the two girls as my wives, for I have given them all
my possessions, but still I have not been able to win them.”

on Makalii and taught him one of the chants in honor of Kamapuaa. After learning the
mele, Makalii chanted it to Kamapuaa, and at the conclusion Makalii asked: “What of
me?” Kamapuaa replied: “You shall not be saved because of this one mele; you must
chant another one.” Makalii again chanted, giving all the meles of Kamapuaa, at the
conclusion of which Makalii was spared by Kamapuaa. By this release of Makalii he
requested of Kamapuaa that he be given a piece of land for himself and his people.
Kamapuaa then said to him: “You must go to Kahiki and live with Koea.” Makalii replied,
saying: “No, I will never live there, for I will have to cross so many seas.” “Go
to Hawaii then and live with Pele.” “I will not be able to live with her.” “Go to

This may have been the foundation for the story of this fabulous creature, Kamapuaa,
whose exploits led him to nearly all parts of the group, thereby becoming interwoven
in many legends and local traditions of the islands. Fornander traces the tradition
of this celebrity to the migratory period of the race, at about the eleventh century.
Among those who arrived from “Kahiki” were the brothers Kahikiula and Olopana, who
settled at Koolau, Oahu, where Olopana took Hina, the daughter of Aumu, to wife. Kamapuaa
was the son of Hina by Kahikiula, and shows windward Oahu to have been his birthplace.

name of the brother who loved him, while the other brother did not like him at all,
in fact he hated him. Some time after this the brother that thought a good deal of
Kaulu was taken away by Kane and Kanaloa,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13341src" href="#xd32e13341">3</a> to the island of Kuaihelani,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13344src" href="#xd32e13344">4</a> where he was kept. Being attached to this brother, because of his great kindness,
Kaulu concluded that he would go to Kuaihelani in search of him. On the voyage Kaulu
encountered several obstacles.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13347src" href="#xd32e13347">5</a> First he encountered large and terrible waves; secondly, he encountered the long

house, so he went to meet him. Kaulu then asked him: “How are you getting along?”
Kaholeha replied: “I am not happy.” Kaulu again asked him: “What do you all do in
the evening?” The brother replied: “We drink awa.” “Yes,” said Kaulu, “when it is
time to drink awa, you tell the gods that they can go ahead and drink their’s and
that you will take your’s later. When it comes to your turn to drink awa, you order
the gods not to talk, and when they are quiet then you call out to me as follows:
‘Say, my god, here is our awa.’ I will then answer back: ‘Drink it. I will take the
intoxicating portion.’ ” The brother returned into the house and in time carried out
the orders given him. When the gods heard the reply from without, they said: “What
a loud voiced god you have. It even calls differently.” This was continued so often
that Kane and Kanaloa became vexed and so they sent their messengers to fly up to

replied: “I came along this way.” “Yes, you will become my food for this day.” Kaulu
made reply: “You can have me if you are strong.” Mokolii then jumped on Kaulu and
held him with its teeth. Kaulu then flew up with Mokolii, and when they got into the

<p>When the capture of the hill was completed, Umi ordered Omaokamau to go and fight
Imaikalani. When Omaokamau heard this he proceeded to the home of Imaikalani. When
Omaokamau was drawing near the home of Imaikalani the birds sounded a note. At this
note of warning from the birds Imaikalani said to his men: “Say, there is a man.”
The men said: “There is nobody.” Imaikalani remarked: “Watch out.” While the two men
were watching, Omaokamau soon after appeared. The men then said to Imaikalani: “Yes,
there is a man, he is coming, and he carries a war club in his hand.” Imaikalani said:
“That is Omaokamau, one of the warriors of Umi; he is well versed in the art of throwing
the spear; his main strength is in his right arm, his left is weak; watch him and
see when he twirls his war club.”

blow by the use of his club and the first blow aimed by Omaokamau missed. They again
twirled their clubs and after a time Omaokamau struck to his left, but again his blow
was warded off and he again missed Imaikalani. After this second miss Omaokamau turned
around and returned to Umi. When he came up to Umi, Umi asked him: “How was your trip
to the home of Imaikalani?” Omaokamau replied: “I don’t know what to say. The eyes
of Imaikalani are both sightless but his thinking powers are faultless. I fought him
for a time, but he warded off my blows so skilfully that I was afraid of him and so
I came back.”

club and let it come down on his left, but again he was foiled. When Koi saw that
he could not get the best of Imaikalani, he turned around and returned to Umi. When
he came in the presence of Umi, Umi asked him: “How did you get along with your trip

him with my own eyes. What Omaokamau has said and all the things which we have heard
are perfectly true, and I must therefore give the same report. After I had twirled
my club once on the second time I struck at Imaikalani, but from what I could see
it was as nothing to him. After the first blow I gave him another one but that, too,
was as nothing to Imaikalani. I therefore became afraid and returned.” While Koi was
giving his account of the encounter, Piimaiwaa spoke up to Koi: “The bones of a youngster
like you could not be old enough; here are the bones that are well matured.” Piimaiwaa
then stood up, took up his club and started off. When he came up with Imaikalani,
he heard the birds. His appearance was then reported by the men to Imaikalani, that
another warrior was coming. As Piimaiwaa stood in the presence of Imaikalani, Imaikalani
stood up ready to defend himself. After trying his skill against Imaikalani Piimaiwaa

Omaokamau. Because of this promise made by Omaokamau, the man said: “The birds which

of any person. On hearing this warning he prepared himself for the conflict. The men
with him are also his eyes; they are the ones who tell him when the enemy is near

<p>When Omaokamau heard this from the man, he stood up and started off to carry out the
advice given him. When he came up to the place where the birds generally sat he crept
up cautiously and struck them with his club, killing them. But before Omaokamau had
the chance to kill the birds, they gave their warning note and Imaikalani heard it;
so he asked his men to look and see if a man was coming. The men then looked and saw
that it was Omaokamau. When Omaokamau came up to the guards, they thought he had come
to do battle with Imaikalani, and that he would come to the battle ground and there
make his stand, when Imaikalani would get ready to fight him; but in this they were
mistaken, for Omaokamau did not go to the battle ground but came right along fearlessly
with his war club in his hand. As soon as he came up to the two men he struck them
with his war club, killing them. He then turned to Imaikalani and poked him in the
stomach with the point of his club, killing him.

<p>Omaokamau then returned to Umi, the king, and told him of the death of Imaikalani,
slain by his hands. When Umi and the rest of the people heard this, they asked him
how he was able to kill the great and famous Imaikalani. Omaokamau then said to them:
“This is how I was able to slay Imaikalani: Yesterday on going down to the stream
of <span class="corr" id="xd32e13761" title="Source: Manoni">Mauoni</span> for a bath, I met a Maui man who asked me: ‘Have you people killed Imaikalani?’ I
said, ‘No.’ Then he said to me: ‘Yes, it is only a small thing to kill him.’ When
I heard this, I asked him to tell me how it could be done, while I promised him at
the same time that I would keep his name and identity a secret. He then told me how
I was to do it; said he, ‘Here is the way to kill Imaikalani: You must first kill
the birds and the two watchmen, who are Imaikalani’s guards and who give him warning
of the approach of any person. Kill the birds and the men, then you will be able to
kill Imaikalani.’ That is how I was able to kill him.”

Hilo, where he found Kukuilauania, a very beautiful woman, but her eyes bulged out,

the women. He then called out to move the mats over to the stern of the canoes. Makolea
did as she was told and had the mats moved to the stern of the canoes, where they
went and slept for the night. After a time Kakaalaneo became so overcome with the
influence of awa that he fell asleep. Kepakailiula then came and took Makolea into
some bushes and spent the night there together. After sleeping for some time, Makolea
awoke and began to weep, believing that Kepakailiula would be killed by Kakaalaneo.
Kepakailiula upon hearing Makolea <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>weeping asked her: “Why are you weeping?” Makolea replied: “I am weeping for you,
for I am afraid my husband will kill you. His spear is never known to miss. He can
hit a blade of grass, an ant or a flea. How can he miss you, your shadow being much
larger?” Kepakailiula then said boastingly:

the spear that was in his right hand at Kepakailiula. When the spear came near Kepakailiula,

blows down houses? Or was it the awa leaf wind of Hana? for my spear has indeed missed
its mark. That spear from my right hand has missed; there yet remains the spear in

<p>The news of the death of Kakaalaneo by Kepakailiula was in time carried to the hearing

and in order to avoid any conflict he thought he would send his own canoes in charge
of his own personal servants to Maui, to invite Kepakailiula to come to Oahu, and
also to adopt him as his son and to offer to him the possession of the island of Oahu.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13987src" href="#xd32e13987">23</a> In time the canoes set out from Oahu on their way to Maui. On account of contrary
winds and a storm that came up soon after they set out, they landed at Kaunolu.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13990src" href="#xd32e13990">24</a> That same evening, however, the wind subsided and the canoes were once more launched
and they got as far as Keanapou in Kahoolawe, where they landed and spent the night.
From this last place they again set sail, landing at Kapueokahi in Hana, Maui, where
Kepakailiula was staying. As soon as the canoes effected a landing the voyagers went
in search and inquired as to the whereabouts of Kepakailiula; they were told that
his house was on the east side of the Kauiki hill. When the people from Oahu arrived
at the house, they met Kepakailiula, who greeted them and they in turn extended theirs.
After resting awhile they told Kepakailiula the object of their mission, saying: “We
have come for you to sail for Oahu. Your father, Kakuhihewa, requests you go to Oahu
and take possession of that island. The canoes are here; all you have to do is to
board them and we will set sail.” Kepakailiula assented<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e13993src" href="#xd32e13993">25</a> to this; whereupon he and his company, consisting of his foster fathers, Kiihele

<p>After Makolea was taken to Kauai, Kepakailiula desired to go to Kauai in search of
his wife. He therefore requested<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e14013src" href="#xd32e14013">28</a> of Kakuhihewa that he be given a canoe to make the voyage. Upon hearing the wish
of Kepakailiula, Kakuhihewa gave him a double canoe and some men; but Kepakailiula
refused to take the men, saying: “I do not want to travel in state, for my wife has
been taken away from me secretly, so I want to travel in secret. All I want from you
is a small canoe.” Kakuhihewa therefore gave him a small canoe, as requested. Kepakailiula
then set sail for Kauai, and on the morning of the next day he reached Waimea. As
soon as he landed he took his canoe and broke it into pieces, then after this was
done he went to the first house he saw, where lived one of the chiefs of Kauai, Kaunalewa
by name, a very rich and honored man. When Kaunalewa saw the goodly appearance of
Kepakailiula he called him, and when he arrived before him he urged that they become
friends, saying: “I want you to become my friend and whatever you request of me I
will grant it.”

warrior was found who could beat him, and in all the contests that were held he always

him down. While he was being held in the umu, he called out to the chiefs and warriors
of Kauai, saying: “Say, are you then to look on unconcernedly while I am being put
to death?” The chiefs and warriors of Kauai then jumped on Kepakailiula and attempted
to kill him, Kepakailiula then took them as they came and broke them like twigs. Kukaea
and Kaunalewa also jumped in and helped Kepakailiula, thus making three on their side.

his arm, with the body of Ihuanu on it, twirled the body around over his head and
then threw it outside of the rows of people that were standing around. At sight of
this great strength a mighty shout came from the people and after this they began

<p>Because he was so taken up with this profession he traveled until he came to Kau,
in Hawaii, where he met two young men whom he had beaten in former contests and from
whom he had won several wagers. Therefore, against the time Kapunohu should meet them,
they prepared an oven of hot stones and had baked some potatoes over the fire. After
the potatoes were cooked the oven was covered. Some time after this was done, they
saw Kapunohu on his way to call on them. Upon seeing Kapunohu the older brother said
to his younger brother: “Here comes Kapunohu,” and they began to remove the covering
from the oven and again recovered it, making believe that it was just being covered
up for the first time. While they were doing this, Kapunohu entered the house. When
they saw that Kapunohu had entered the house, they took up the potatoes that had been
baked over the fire and began eating. While they were eating, the older brother <span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>addressed the younger brother, saying: “I believe the food in our oven is cooked.”
The younger brother replied: “Yes.” The two then made preparations to uncover the
oven. When Kapunohu saw them doing this, he remarked: “How can that be possible?”
The two replied: “It is cooked, let us uncover the oven.” Kapunohu grew very stubborn
and said: “The food is not cooked, because you had just completed covering it when
I entered. How can it be cooked? You two are indeed deceitful.” Because Kapunohu was
so stubborn, a wager was proposed and accepted, and the oven was uncovered. As soon
as this was done, it was found that the food was indeed cooked, and Kapunohu was for
the first time beaten by the two young men.
</p>
<p>Some time after this, the two young men prepared something else. This time they procured
a chicken and cooked it in an oven. They next took some eggs and used the shells for
a plaiting on the outside of a [fish or] meat calabash. After the egg-shell calabash
was completed, they took the cooked chicken and placed it in it, and then put the
thing away to await the coming of Kapunohu. Not very long after this Kapunohu was
seen coming to make another call on them. When they saw him coming they took the egg-shell
calabash and made as though they were going to prepare a meal. When Kapunohu came
in and saw that they were about to begin a meal, he asked them: “Here you two are
ready for your meal, but where is your meat?” The two made reply: “We have chicken
for meat and chicken for a calabash.” Kapunohu denied this, saying: “You two are deceiving
yourselves. Who has ever said that you can have chicken for meat and at the same time
have chicken for a calabash. You two are indeed deceitful.” This debate was kept up
until finally wagers were made and after this was settled, the two brothers proceeded
to uncover the egg-shell calabash, in which the cooked chicken was kept. After these
different things had been shown to Kapunohu, he admitted that he was beaten, so the
two brothers took the wagers. This was the second time that Kapunohu was beaten by
the brothers.

they took up their calabashes and uncovered them and then began their meal, dipping
their fingers into the gravy, licking their fingers and taking some poi. When Kapunohu
saw this he said: “Here you are eating your food, but where is your fish?” The two
replied: “We are eating the food and the fish is human flesh.” Kapunohu replied: “You
two are deceiving yourselves. How can you make out that you are eating human flesh?”
The two, however, insisted that what they said was indeed the truth. After much discussion
wagers were made, and when this was settled one of the brothers said: “The food is

<p>One day he walked down to a stream of water and while he was drinking a ghost came
to the cliff above the place where he was taking his drink and looked down at Lepe.
This ghost happened to be baldheaded. When Lepe looked up and saw the baldheaded ghost,
he called out: “As the drum was beating, up came a baldhead; had there only been two,
what a beautiful sight it would be.” The ghost replied: “If that is what you want,
Lepe, you can have two.” At this up came another baldheaded ghost. Lepe then repeated
what he had said, adding another ghost, until ten baldheaded ghosts stood on the cliff.
With this number, Lepe addressed them saying: “Say, you must be hungry?” “Yes, we
are hungry.” Lepe again said: “Then wait here while I go home and bring the remnants
of my last meal.” Lepe then returned to the house, took up the calabash and excreted
into it, then he urinated into the calabash and stirred up the mixture with a stick.
He then took up the coconut shell dish containing some salt and went back to the place
where the ghosts were waiting for him, carrying the calabash and the salt dish. When
Lepe came up to the ghosts, they took the calabash and stuck their fingers into it
and ate the food, and said: “Oh, my, how bad this food does smell and how awfully
bitter it is!” Lepe replied: “You see I am all alone by myself, and being alone, I
eat my food from the time it is fresh and sweet until it turns sour on me, before
I finish it. If I had such a large company as you are with me, why the food would
be finished while it is still fresh, and it would not turn sour in the calabash.”
With this the ghosts continued on eating until the whole mixture in the calabash was
finished. After the mixture had been consumed, Lepe called out: “Serve you right,
you have all eaten the dung of Lepe.” When the ghosts heard this, they all became
angry with Lepe, and said: “We are going <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>to kill you for this.” Lepe replied: “If you should kill me you will not have anybody

said to them: “The game is this: here are ten different arms leading to that hill;
each of you take an arm and dig with all your might towards that hill; whoever gets
there first, wins.” The ghosts began digging and when they reached the hill their
hands were all besmeared with the filth. This made the ghosts more angry with Lepe

house where the ghosts made their home. As he was drawing near the house, one of the
ghosts said: “Say, that fellow looks like Lepe, only this fellow is black on one side.”
Another ghost said: “That fellow is not Lepe for he is black on one side, Lepe is
different.” When Lepe arrived, the ghosts asked him: “Are you the only one who has
come?” Lepe replied: “No, there are ten of us black fellows. I am the tenth, and the

<p>After pushing away in his canoe, he said: “Paddle for Kaupo, Kanaiahuea.” With this
he headed for the point of land directly opposite the house and bumped into the rocks.
He then turned about and after a time he again bumped into the rocks on that side.
In this way the bow as well as the stern of his canoe were smashed. At daylight the
next day, when the people woke up they saw that the canoe of Kanaiahuea was floating
not very far from the landing, and the people made up their mind that it could not
have reached its destination. Therefore Kanaiahuea’s fame has descended to the present
time for not knowing how to paddle a canoe.

to the uplands to till the soil, while others had gone fishing, therefore, they were

<p>While Kamalalawalu was on the hill of Hokuula, in Waimea, he beheld the dust rising
above the stones of Kaniku, the stones being gradually reddened by the dirt. On account
of the many men the darkness of the stones was covered by the dust. And when Kamalalawalu
saw the men of Kaniku advancing, he inquired of Kauhiakama:<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15395src" href="#xd32e15395">32</a> “Where have you traveled on Hawaii that you failed to observe the people?” Kauhiakama
answered: “From Kawaihae to Kaawaloa, in Kona, were the places I visited, but I encountered
no person.” Kamalalawalu said to Kauhiakama: “Did you not see houses standing?” “There
were houses indeed, but there were no occupants. There were pigs running about, and
there were chickens crowing.” Whereupon, Kumaikeau and Kumakaia remarked: “You could
not find the occupants at home, for they had gone upland to till the ground because
it was morning, and they had gone out fishing. If it were in the afternoon you went
there, you would have met the men at home.”

<p>Oulu was a famous warrior of Maui at the time of the reign of Kahekili, a great king
of Maui. Oulu is very widely known even to this day on all the islands of this Hawaii,
because of his great skill in throwing the sling-stone. The stone of Oulu never missed
man, pig, dog, chicken, or any bird. If Oulu should cast his sling-stone, the fire
would ignite,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15704src" href="#xd32e15704">4</a> and the soil would be furrowed when the ala fell. Oulu could contend with a collective

all the district chiefs. For that reason, Oulu was highly esteemed by Kahekili up
to the time of his death.

island to Kahekili, the king of Maui, but afterwards rebelled and ignored that cession.
Because of this renunciation by Kahahana, the report of which reached Kahekili, therefore,
Kahekili sailed here with his war fleet and landed at Waikiki. He dispatched a messenger
to summon Kahahana to come before him to consult<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15842src" href="#xd32e15842">4</a> relative to the truth or falsity of the rumor.

the only alternative; then, battle preparations were made. These arrangements were
made at Waikiki-kai. When the curtains of dawn parted, the ranks commenced to march
up to Nuuanu. Whilst they were ascending, the rumor reached Peapea in the upland of
Manoa, where he was residing, in the woman’s house. These were the words reported

Peapea. Many were the messengers Kahekili sent, but Kekuapoi never came, for she was

Keoua (First), the father of Kamehameha, was the younger brother of Kalaiopuu.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e15994src" href="#xd32e15994">2</a> Another name of Keoua was Kalaninuikupuapaikalaninui. The place where Kamehameha
was raised from his childhood up, was at Halawa, in Kohala. Here he became a planter.
He planted the trees which are still growing to this day, which are the <i lang="haw">noni</i>, and other kinds. He also built the temple (heiau) of Hapuu, in Halawa. Thus were
spent his days when he was poor and destitute of land. Of Kamehameha’s person, he
had a large body, which looked to be solidly built, and was very broad on the shoulders.
He was full formed without defects, and there was an abundance of muscles on his neck.

<p>On another occasion, Kamehameha displayed his great strength when he and his own personal
attendant, Hema, alone went into a fight with Keoua at Koapapaa, in Kekualele, and
at Kealakaha, in Hamakua. There was a deep ravine, and very narrow at the bottom.
Kamehameha and Hema went down till they reached this limited space, when they met
Keoua’s warriors. Forty of them with their spears and javelins jumped on Kamehameha,
but they were as nothing to him. He stretched out his hands, caught the warriors,
and broke them in two, one after another, all of the time moving onward. Thus Kamehameha
slaughtered the soldiers until there remained only ten, when he became exhausted.
He then told his servant, “Say, help me out.” Hema<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16127src" href="#xd32e16127">17</a> immediately jumped into the fray, killing the remaining ten; and on that day he became
a chief of Kamehameha, being released from his position of attendant.

four of them: Kai, Kapalaoa, Kaaloa and Kauakahiakaola. With these people Kamehameha
carried out all of his works, and through them important laws were made, which carried
great influence upon the people, such as the <i lang="haw">Mamalahoa</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16310src" href="#xd32e16310">41</a> and the <i lang="haw">Maumae</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16318src" href="#xd32e16318">42</a> “that the old and the infirm might lie down in the road and not be molested.”

day, and his life was saved, and Keoua defeated. Hence the name Koapapaa until this

of Kamehameha not borne out by facts in the case, notably the account of his early
arrival at and conquest of Oahu, and the length of his reign. Pihana and possibly
other celebrities are also tinged with like inaccuracies. The collection, as gathered,
is therefore presented as illustrative of Hawaiian narrative literature pure and simple,
irrespective of wide variance from known facts, without attempt to alter or amend
such to agree with the historical record.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd32e15991src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">Kekuawahine was a master hand at deceiving and falsifying; he could turn an untruth
into a reality; from correct to incorrect, and so forth. When Kamehameha was residing
at Pakaka,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e16622src" href="#xd32e16622">1</a> Kona, Oahu (that is the place where “White man Jim” lives), at the time that the
islands from Hawaii to Niihau were subjugated by him, he was living with his wife,
Kaahumanu. Kanaihalau was an uncle of Kaahumanu, whom she placed in power over Hamakua,
Kawaihae and Waimea. These lands are on Hawaii, and of course, Kanaihalau became very
much favored by his niece, Kaahumanu. On this account Kekuawahine and all the chiefs
were very envious of him, and could not get along together at Waimea and Kawaihae.
Therefore Kekuawahine meditated on a plan of action.

however, Kanaihalau and Malaihi, who were chiefs over Hamakua, Waimea and Kawaihae.
Malaihi was at Oahu, residing with Kekuawahine, and while thus living together, Kekuawahine
said to Malaihi: “Let us go until we come near to the presence of Kamehameha; you
will then stay behind, and I will go forward and have conversation with Kamehameha,

Kaalamakaoikuwa. Instantly Makaioulu was seized and held prisoner, while Naaimokuokama
ran away. And while he was running, Makaioulu called after him: “Do you run away and
leave me?” When Naaimokuokama heard this he stopped. Makaioulu then said: “Hurl that
spear that you hold in your hand straight to my navel.” Naaimokuokama did so, and
at the same time that he did, Makaioulu dodged to one side, the spear striking Kaalamakaoikuwa
and killing him. Makaioulu escaped, and they went thence to Puowaina.

and if they hurl at my side you stand at my right. Do not wink or you will be hit.”
Makaioulu then faced about and went forward. And when he came near to the ten men

load the waves dashed over him, then he would brace himself against them by thrusting
his staff against the precipice, then went on when the waves receded.

country, and I am a woman of this place, also a resident of it; you may want to get
me for your wife.” Namakaeha replied to Mahinahina: “I do not desire such between
us, because I have a wife still at Kahiki; but because of my great desire to go traveling,

of this place.” They continued on until the woman spied them, when she called out:
“The stranger and the kamaaina arrive. It is unfortunate that you do not find me in
the flesh; this is a spirit body which exists; my way of living is not right, for
I am only a spirit as you see; because I was much ashamed of Puuhele, therefore, I
died.” Namakaeha quickly spoke to Mahinahina: “Let us proceed.” They kept on their
way until they were seen by Lehoula, who came along to a little hillock; and while
Lehoula was waving to them, the spirit woman chanted as follows:

“On our way, if Pele should see us first, she wins, but if we should spy her first,
we win.” So they went along, and Namakaeha caught sight of her first and he said to

said Namakaeha, “and also to seek out champions” (for opponents). Pele said: “I had
thought it was a journey for a good purpose, but it is a journey with an evil design.”
While they were talking Lehoula disappeared, and went back to her place. These two
fought until Pele was weakened. The body of Pele was then taken and the bones were
stripped of flesh and taken and buried in the ground. They were exhumed by dogs, placed
in a pile and that was why this hill was so named, because the bones of Pele were
stripped off there. Perhaps others have a different explanation, but this is what
I have obtained by questioning friends concerning this subject. This hill stands on
the east side of Maui, near Hana.

So he stretched out his legs and with one foot on one side of the precipice and the

Waipu and Kaluaokapuhi. Holu was carried by the water to the sea; he tore off a part

He did not wish for birds from the beach.
When the birds were obtained, they were to be taken to the priest for him to ascertain
where the birds came from; if he should give out the same information as the men had
given to the chief as to the source of the birds, then he would be safe; if he should
give a contrary answer, he would be killed. The name of this priest was Luahoomoe,

at all, so they decided to get some shore birds. When they caught some, they daubed
the feathers red with dirt so that the chief would think the birds came from the mountain.
When they returned and handed the birds to the chief, he was exceedingly glad because
he thought the birds came from the mountain. The chief told the men to take them to
the priest for his inspection. The priest perceived, however, that the birds came
from the seashore, so he told the chief that they did not come from the mountain,

you have guessed wrongly.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17645src" href="#xd32e17645">14</a> I can very well see that these are mountain birds.” Then and there an imu was prepared

do not think of any other woman for a wife; let the daughter of Puuhele and his wife
be your wife. With that wife you will live well, and your bones be cared for.<span class="corr" id="xd32e17653" title="Not in source">”</span> Then the priest was cast into the oven and the opening closed up tightly. The smoke
arose and darkened the sky; for six days did the smoke darken the sky before the fire
in the imu gave out. But after the priest had been in the imu for two days, he reappeared
and sat by the edge of the imu unknown to any one; the chief thinking all the time
that he was dead; but it was not so.
</p>
<p>When the smoke ascended and leaned towards the Oloalu mountains, the two sons went
off in that direction; the cloud pointed towards Hanaula, and there it stood still,
so the two sons ascended to the place and resided there.
</p>
<p>Then the whole of Maui became dry; no rain, not even a cloud in the sky, and people
died from lack of water. The smoke that hung over Hanaula became a cloud, and rain
fell there. The two men became planters so as to furnish their wife Puuoinaina with
food.

<p>But when Pele heard what Puuoinaina had done she became angry. She then cursed Puuoinaina.
When Puuoinaina heard this cursing from Pele she felt so ashamed that she ran into
the sea. She left her home, Kohemalamalama, now called Kahoolawe. Pele, residing at
Kahikinui, thought so much of her husband, Lohiau, who was living at Kealia, Kamaalaea,
that she started out to meet him; but she found her way blocked by Puuhele, so she
went from there and waded through the sea. She saw her lizard rival, Puuoinaina, stretching
from Kahoolawe to Makena, so she came along and cut the lizard in two, right in the
middle, separating the tail from the head. The tail became Puuolai at Makena, and
the head became Molokini. When the husbands heard that their wife was dead, they looked
and beheld the head of their beloved standing in the sea, so they called the name
of the islet Molokini. That is the story of how it was born of its parents and how
it obtained this new name Molokini.

<p>Here is the reason why Molokini was detached from Haupu. It was during the battles
of Kana with the chief of Haupu; the latter had taken his mother, and Kana wanted
her released to return to her husband; the husband had felt very badly because his
mate, the wife, was separated from him; he had cast about for a way of getting her
back, but found none. So the father thought that Kana could bring her back, because
he had numerous bodies, and he was born in a queer way. But when Kana went to get
the mother, the hill started to grow upwards and nearly touched the heaven. This was
the reason for it: there were two turtles under the mountain; so when Kana went over
for his mother, the people on the mountain called to the turtle in this manner: “O
Kahakauwila, lift up the hill;” then the mountain would rise until Kana became a dwarf
alongside of it. This was continued until Kana was hungry, because his food had given
out, so he laid down towards Uli, his grandmother, who was residing on Hawaii. She
nourished him until he grew large. When his younger brother saw that Kana’s feet were
plump he said to himself, “Strange! here you have enough to eat and I live in hunger;
I shall cut off your feet.” So he cut off Kana’s feet. Kana said to his grandmother:
“My feet are getting cold.” The grandmother replied: “Yes, your younger brother noticed
that your feet were fat; he became peeved; and that was why he chopped them off.”

<p>Then Kana arose and commenced the fight with his enemy again; the mountain started

Kana also rose up. They went up together until the hill was lower than Kana. Kana
tipped it, and when the people [on the hill] looked up and saw Kana’s eyes glaring
down at them, they trembled with fear. Kana then trod the hill, and broke <span class="pageNum" id="pb520">[<a href="#pb520">520</a>]</span>it into small pieces; some flew over towards Koolau, Oahu; some were thrown right

<p>Secondly, concerning her bringing the Flood and all else relating to that journey.
It is said that here in Hawaii in the earliest times there was no sea; the land was
exposed. There was not even fresh water, but because she brought the sea it reached
Hawaii. Because Pele was displeased on account of her husband being enticed from her,
she came to Hawaii; her parents gave her the sea, so that when she came she could
bring her canoes. She arrived at Pakuela, and from there she came to Kanaloa where
she poured out the sea from her head, and there and then Hawaii first received the
sea. When the sea broke [on the land] her brothers composed this chant:

he awoke he found that the fire had commenced to burn his feet, and that was really
the reason for his awakening; but the brother-in-law still slept. The fire, however,
had commenced to consume his feet; so he tried to awaken him, but without any success;
the fire burned up to the knee, and he was still trying to awaken the brother-in-law;
he kept this up until his stomach, his breast and his shoulders were consumed. When
the fire reached the neck he ran away. He climbed a hill and when near the top he
heard the head calling: “Let us not go home now; wait until I arrive, then we will
go home together.” But he kept on running; the head meanwhile kept on calling from
behind. He passed one hill and while descending the second hill, the head commenced
to roll after him. At the same time he saw tongues of fire shooting out from the rolling
head. It called again, “O Head! O Head! retard him so that I can catch him.” They
thus raced along until a number of valleys had been passed; and when they reached
the plains above Puulaina he realized that the head was close behind him, so he did
not go by way of Puulaina but made a short cut for the sea by the trail heading for

be saved; but if he be caught above here he would be fortunate if he lives.”

<p>Soon after this conversation the prophet appeared. He had gone on until an idea occurred
to him to return, because he realized that if he did not come back then all these
people would be eaten by this god; for the head was not dead; its spirit still lived.
And when he came to where these two were talking he said: “I have returned because
I feared you would all be consumed. Your husband is coming, but it will be when nearing
night; you will then behold your husband coming to you in the same way he usually
appeared. So, do not stay here; all of you go to your brother’s house, and we will
wait there. When he arrives then all of you surround me so that he can not see me;
do you not, however, acquiesce in his request to come back and live with him, because
if you do you will surely die.”

You will not fail to notice his coming; when the outside here is lighted up, he has

<p>After the prophet was through talking, the woman went and stayed in the house. All
kept awake, however, and at about midnight, they heard the sound of a whistle, and
they knew that he would soon appear; when the whistle sounded again the prophet ran
over to the house where the woman was and said to her: “Should your head of a husband
ask you to give him your son to rear, do not consent; and should he ask you to come
outside do not go outside, else you die.” The real reason for his coming up, however,
was to find out whether or not she was asleep; but when he called, she answered. So
the prophet returned to the house from which he came. Arrived there, he heard another
whistle, and still another, and after that the head arrived at the house and called
out to the wife, “O Kaneikiawaiuli!” The other answered. The head said: “Please come
out here.” Kaneikiawaiuli replied: “I will not come out.” “Why not?” asked the head.

it was then the prophet and others ran and blocked the doorway, and the woman ran

<p>This potato was planted at Manoa, Oahu, on the northwestern slope of Manoa. There
were two potato fields, one for Kupihe and the other for Kapanaia. Kupihe planted
his potato on the side hill while Kapanaia planted his on the flat. When they were
cultivating, only one potato was found in Kapanaia’s field, so he hilled it up. But
the potato grew large and became exposed from the hill in which it was planted; the
field of the other man, however, did not contain any potato. Afterwards they went
to their homes, and on the next day they went up again to cultivate. Kapanaia hastened
to see [his potato], but when he looked there was no lump in the hill; he searched
but could not find the potato. He looked here and there, but he could not find it.
So he went up to Kupihe’s, the field on the hillside. When he looked, he saw this
potato causing a lump in the other’s potato hill, and Kupihe was hilling up the soil.
Kapanaia stood there and asked, “Whose potato is this?” The other answered: “It is
mine, for it is growing in my potato-hill.” After their quarrel over the potato they
returned to their homes. That night the potato rolled down the hill and made a deep
hole where it first struck; from there it bounced and became again attached to its
parent vine. That is one version of the story. But in the story which I heard, it
is stated that the stem of this potato was bitten by a rat and the potato rolled down
until it landed in Kapanaia’s field, and it was left there until new sprouts commenced
to grow from it. That is why new sprouts come from potatoes as we see them now. That
was why this potato at Makiki was called Ualakaa, because it rolled [down hill]. Another
name which I heard [applied to it] was Iolekaa (rolling rat). Another has it that
Kaauhelemoa pecked at the stem of this potato and it rolled to Kapanaia’s field, because
Pupuulima chased after it.

of this story which we are considering. But after some time Eeke became entangled,
for he saw a beautiful woman, Puuwaiohina from Kauaula, and they committed adultery.
Because of this, Lihau thought to choke the child to death, so that the two of them
could go and do mischief; this caused them to quarrel. Eeke took the child to his
mother, Maunahoomaha,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17972src" href="#xd32e17972">47</a> and left him with her. After that their god, Hinaikauluau, placed a restriction over
them; they were not to live together, nor were they to have any intercourse with others;
but ten days after this order, Eeke again committed adultery with Puuwaiohina above
referred to, who was a younger sister to Lihau. Because of this their god punished
them by making Eeke a mountain and Puuwaiohina a mountain ridge; that is the ridge
prominent at Kauaula. There is, it seems, a hole below the highest point of this ridge.
When sound issues from this hole, that is the time the kauaula<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e17976src" href="#xd32e17976">48</a> wind blows a fierce gale.

<p>Moemoe called out sarcastically, “You can not catch the sun for you are a low down
farmer.” Maui answered, “When I conquer my enemy and satisfy my desire I shall kill
you.” He came to Haleakala, and when the sun passed directly over him he snared it
with the coco-husk, and broke some of its rays; he repeated this and broke all the
strong rays of the sun. He said: “I am killing you because you travel so fast.” The
sun requested, “Let me live; you watch how I travel.” He looked and beheld that it
traveled slower, so he desisted from going after it again. That is why the sun goes
slowly. And the name “Haleakala” given to it now is not correct; it should be Alehela,
on account of Maui’s snaring the rays of the sun.

turn out that way. After some time a fire was seen burning [on Lanai], therefore the
chiefs wondered whether or not Kaululaau was dead on account of this lighted fire.
The important point from these explanations is that Kekaa was the birthplace of Kaululaau,
the famous one who traveled all over Lanai fighting the numerous ghosts there and
made it a land fit to be inhabited by human beings as it is at the present time.

down from the top of the hill without any cause. Listening to it, it seemed as if

<p>It is said that when a person dies his spirit journeys to Kekaa; if he has a friend
there who had previously died, that one would drive it away when the spirit is nearing

slept, Maui was traveling, each according to his taste. While Moemoe was sleeping
a freshet came down and covered him with debris, with the exception of his nostrils;
a kukui nut, however, rested on his nostrils and commenced to grow. It grew tall and
at the same time tickled the nostrils of Moemoe; so he awoke and said: “Here I am
at my favorite pastime, asleep, and yet I am awakened by this cursed kukui tree.”
So he made up his mind to give up this to which he was addicted and to search for

and Hiiaka were born with human bodies, while Puuhele was a bloody foetus when she
was born. The elders despised this body, because when they beheld it it was not a
human body, but only a foetus of blood; so the two conspired and said one to the other:
“It were better for us to throw away our younger sister. How can we care for it? Of
course we would care for it if it had a human body!” So they threw away the bloody
foetus without the knowledge of the parents.

<p>To the north of Kahulili, with its foundation right under Kauiki, was what was known
as the hair of Puuhele. Kaihuakala is mauka of Kauiki. Kaihuakala is not usually seen;
when Maui is calm, then that locality is seen. Then Papahawahawa stands forth and

lived together until the child had grown up, and his body had acquired strength, when
Pumaia said to his father, “You will please let me go to see the club of my grandmother.”
The father gave his consent. The son went, and arriving at the house of Kiha, his
grandmother, he asked, “Where is the club?” “Here it is,” said the grandmother. He
took it. The nets of calabashes<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18306src" href="#xd32e18306">91</a> were thereby dashed to the ground and broken to pieces. He shouldered the club and
commenced his journey. He caught up with Wakaina, and the latter inquired, “Where
are you journeying to?” “Going sightseeing,” replied Pumaia. “Please let me go with
you.” Pumaia consented and they went along.

are ghosts?” said the others. So they laid wagers. Pupuilima then said to them, “I

they are spirits.” He spread it. Meanwhile Pumaia said to Wakaina, “There is our death
being prepared.” “How shall we be saved?” Pumaia explained: “Where my feet tread there
you tread; because I was raised from my young days until I died, and until I found
you; for this process is like that done to Pamano when by the spreading of an ape
leaf he was saved.” So when they proceeded Pumaia trod on the ape leaf and it broke
through; the friend treaded after him. They were chased by the prophet until they
were caught. That is what I have obtained.

<p>Let us leave the ghosts and speak of the prophets. While the prophets were following,
and because Pueonuiokona was the faster, an idea occurred to one of them, and he said
to himself, “If I catch up to that prophet I shall kill him, for he is simply going
after my enemies to save them.” The owl went along slowly until his fellow prophet
thundered after him and gave his hand a jerk. Pueo asked, “What wrong has a fellow
committed that you should tug at the arm from behind and thereby nearly tripping me?”
The other replied with blazing eyes, “Who told you to go after my enemies with the
intention of saving them? Why don’t you look for your own, and on them practice saving?”
The owl replied: “If you excel in strength you can obtain them, but if you are weak
you can not have them; because I, even I, am an old resident of this plain. When spirits
from the dead arrive I cause them to revive. Also no prophet comes to this plain;
this is the first time that I have seen a prophet on this plain, and that is yourself.

fisherman who used to go fishing for them, and he passed long periods at his occupation.
One day Kapokoholua sailed out on the ocean in a canoe to fish. When he had gone Puupehe
commenced a conversation from inside the mother’s womb. When Puupehe spoke the mother
was startled from her sleep, and she wondered at this strange sound which she heard.
She went to sleep again; the live one called out, “Say, my dear mother, do thou awake;
father is dead.” The mother then realized that it was a human voice, but she could
see no human being. She ran quickly and stood at the door of the house and looked
round for the owner of the voice, but she could see no one; she thought, however,
that it was her husband, but she was disappointed. She returned and sat in the house.

I had better explain shortly about his chanting and falsely stating that his father
was dead. It was not true as he chanted. He had gone to watch his father fishing,
and he had sent for a great number of fish to come and bite the hook. He saw that
his father had caught a great many fish, but he needed the second [requisite], the
awa root. He knew his parents had none; that was why he voiced the few lines of song
above written.

<p>Let us drop what the child did for some later time and turn and talk of the father.
While his father was fishing he became very much interested because he caught so many.
When he glanced shoreward he could not see land, because Puupehe had covered it completely
with fog. He thought to himself, “What can this wonderful thing be? There is now no
wind to bring the fog on to the land!” He had a premonition, however, concerning his
wife, so he commenced to pull in his line. When it was near the top his line was held
by a shark. The name of this shark was Puaiki.

a shark holding on he jerked the line; the fish took him to a point near the cape
of Papawai here on Maui; from there he again came outside of Manele.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18391src" href="#xd32e18391">97</a> He noticed that their house was surrounded by a many-colored cloud. When he arrived
at his old fishing ground his line and hook were broken off. He returned and when
near shore he saw his wife standing on the seashore beckoning to him. He said to himself,
“You are unaccountable, my wife; you can see that I am returning.” With one scoop
of his paddle in the sea the bow of the canoe landed on the sand. The wife ran to
him and grasped him tremblingly. He asked, “What is the cause of this heavy breathing?”
She replied, with tears, “Our child has acted the ghost to me.” <span class="corr" id="xd32e18394" title="Not in source">“</span>For what reason?” “For this reason: soon after you were gone I went to sleep and slept

<p class="first">This is the way the fire was obtained, according to some people. Maui took to wife
Hina and begat Mauimua,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18447src" href="#xd32e18447">99</a> Mauihope,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18450src" href="#xd32e18450">100</a> Mauikiikii<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18453src" href="#xd32e18453">101</a> and Mauiokalana;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18456src" href="#xd32e18456">102</a> they were all boys. The occupation of these boys was fishing. This was their practice
in fishing while living at Kaupo, Maui: Mauiokalana wished to go fishing; he said
to his elder brothers: “Say, this is a calm day; shouldn’t we sail the sea? for this
is a good day, the sea is calm; this is a day when the tide is not strong in its opposition
for it is flowing in one direction.” When he had finished speaking, Mauimua answered:
“Let us not sail, for this will be a tempestuous day; this calmness which we see is
only in the morning; when the sun rises you will see the waves rise, the wind will
increase, and in a short time we will be obliged to return. Put off your fishing until
a calm day.” Then Mauiokalana spoke again: “Why, I thought because you are the first-born
you knew the signs of the sky, but I see you do not! Your yellow teeth signify nothing.”
Then Mauimua, displeased, answered: “Say, my younger <span class="pageNum" id="pb562">[<a href="#pb562">562</a>]</span>brother, you do not realize that I am the one acquainted with the ways of this place.
This is the sign I know about: when you sleep until near morning, and should hear
the breaking surf above the wind, then it will be calm. That is my sign, that you
may hear, my younger brother. But what of it? let us sail according to your urging.”
<span class="corr" id="xd32e18462" title="Source: Maumua">Mauimua</span> ordered the canoes lifted to the beach. The canoes were taken to the shore, and they
prepared to sail for fishing. When they arrived at the reef they saw a fire burning
on land. Then <span class="corr" id="xd32e18465" title="Source: Mauikolana">Mauiokalana</span> said to his elder brothers: “Say, there is a fire burning; whose fire can this be?”
The others replied: “Whose indeed? Perhaps we had better return so we can cook some
food for us.” “Pshaw! Let us first go and get some fish, then return; so that when
we get back with fish we can broil them, cook the food, and then [we can] sleep well,
being satisfied.” They went on; in no time they had caught some fish. They then returned.
As soon as they arrived at the beach Mauimua left the canoe, and ran to where the
fire was seen burning. Kaalaehuapi<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18468src" href="#xd32e18468">103</a> saw him so he and the others threw dirt on the fire and smothered it, and flew away.
Mauimua was disappointed; he returned to their house. The others asked, “How about
the fire?” “There is no fire; it is put out; I thought it was man, but it was not;
some mudhens kindled the fire. Our bananas are being stolen.” Because they saw that
their bananas were being stolen they did not go fishing; they hoped the fire would
be kindled again, but it was not lighted. Then they went fishing again. Whenever they
went out fishing the fire would burn. Thus were they harassed, but they could not
get anything, because Kaalaehuapi knew that Maui and Hina had four sons. When they
went fishing Kaalaehuapi counted them; when they were all present it would light the
fire.

<p>But Maui thought of a plan and he said to his brothers, “Say, tomorrow morning you
go fishing; I will remain. You will place our calabash in front where I sit. You will
cover it with kapa. Then you will go to sea.” The others consented and they went.
Kaalaehuapi saw them and counted Mauimua, Mauihope, Mauikiikii, Mauiokalana. He counted
all present, so the mudhens lighted the fire and roasted the bananas. Before the bananas
were cooked, Kaalaehuapi said, “Say, they’re done; Hina’s son is swift.” It was then
Maui jumped to grab and caught Kaalaehuapi. Then he said, “I will kill you, you mudhen.
You folks indeed have the fire and you are hiding it. I will kill you, you mudhen.
Kaalaehuapi said, “If I die, the fire can not be obtained.” The other mudhens called
out, “O Kaalaehuapi, hold on to the fire; do not tell.” Maui commenced to twist the
neck of the mudhen, planning to kill it dead there and then. The mudhen again spoke:
“Grant me life, then you will obtain the fire.” Maui asked, “Where is the fire?” “In
the stalk of the ape leaf.” So he went to rubbing, but it would not light; he asked
again, “Where is the fire?” The other directed: “In the stalk of the taro leaf.” He
again went to rubbing, but it would not light; the stalk of the taro leaf became grooved,
but no fire was produced; that is why the stalk of the ape and the taro leaf has a
groove, because of Maui’s rubbing for fire. Again he asked, “Where is the fire which
you are hiding?” “In the green wood.” He rubbed that, but it would not ignite. Again
he asked. He kept doing this until it <span class="pageNum" id="pb564">[<a href="#pb564">564</a>]</span>came to the dry wood; there he found the fire. When he had produced fire, he rubbed
the head of the mudhen. That is why the mudhen has a red head as we see it now. And
from that time was fire obtained and has been handed down to the present time.

<p>Fire is used to cook food and fish. It also helps in the work of man, because in cultivating
some people use fire [to burn off rubbish] before planting the leaves. The fire has
various other uses; they can not all be explained because the time is limited.

<p>Let us leave off consideration of this brave man and this daring fellow, and speak
of the child in the womb of the mother at Hawaii. When the child was born, a female
prophet saw that this was to be a strong child, and no one who dared him could escape.
The name of this old woman was Kolea, and she lived near the home of the child’s parents.
The child was brought up until he had attained manhood, when <span class="pageNum" id="pb566">[<a href="#pb566">566</a>]</span>the desire seized him to go sightseeing. He said to his father, “I am desiring to
go sightseeing.” The father said: “Where do you wish to travel to?” He replied: “Along
here, somewheres.” The father said: “If you wish to go sightseeing, your sister is
at an island ahead here, at Kauai.” The son asked: “What is the name of the place
where they are living?” The father told him, “At Mana, Kauai.” He waited for some
time. Again the father said, “Should you go, and your sister does not recognize you,
tell her about us, and she will then know you.” He agreed to do so. They lived together
until the aspiring one went on his journey of sightseeing. The father first secured
the club on which their calabashes were hanging, and gave it into the hands of the
lad. He was taught how to cast the spear, until it was seen that he was very proficient.
He then went along, carrying the club with him. He made a circuit of Hawaii. Finding
a canoe about to sail for Maui he went and stood at the landing place. The men of
the canoe saw what a handsome man he was. The names of the owners of the canoe were
Liuliu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e18522src" href="#xd32e18522">111</a> Makaukau and Aumai. The men said to the lad, “Where are you journeying to?” “Sailing
for Maui; and I came to inquire concerning your canoe; where is it bound?” “We are
sailing for Maui,” they replied. They sailed together and arrived at Maui. Their canoe
landed at Kukui, Kipahulu. He (the lad) came along and slept at Pelekane, Lahaina.
When he found a canoe going to Molokai, he sailed in it and was landed at Halawa,
Molokai. He went sightseeing, and because of the heat of the sun he went in bathing.
The name of the place where he bathed is Hakawai. He left his club on the bank. A
man arrived and took it saying, “I have found something at Hakawai.” Then the lad
said to the man, “You are taking my club; mine is the next [move] when I shall kill
you.” The man had a spear. The lad followed him; when the man threw the spear at the
boy the latter caught it first at the point; in returning it the man was struck in
the pit of the stomach and the spear pierced the back. The lad stuck the butt of the
spear in the ground and impaled the man on it. He kept on his journey. Arriving at
Kaunakahakai his spear was taken by one of the champions of the place to a cave. No
sooner had the other entered the cave than the lad also appeared and asked for his
spear; but it was not given him. He closed the mouth of the cave; when there was a
small opening left, he lighted a fire. On account of the heat in the cave from the
fire, the local champion thrust out the point of the spear. The boy caught and jerked
it, but the tip was already burned. He went along until he found a canoe sailing for
Lanai. He boarded this canoe and met Pololu. He did not tarry long at this place.
He again boarded the canoe which brought him from Molokai and sailed for Oahu, landing
at Ewa. He stayed there for some time, then sailed for Kauai and landed at Wailua,
but kept on until he arrived at Mana. He asked a woman whom he met, “Do you know Kamauoha?”
“Yes; this is his house by which we now stand.” He turned in there; arriving at the
door of the house he noticed that inside the house was full of people. His sister
called, not knowing that this was her brother. She asked, “From where did you come?”
He replied, “I came from Hawaii, seeking for my sister Luukia.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb568">[<a href="#pb568">568</a>]</span>The other asked who his parents were, and he explained all from the beginning to the
end. So they began to wail. They wailed from that day to night, and all through the
night to the next day. The husband of the sister thought that this was a lover of
hers. Then he told the people to prepare food; at the same time he instructed them:
“When you have prepared food and the finger bowl is set in the middle, I will call
him to come and eat; when he washes his hands in the basin, then I will say this:
‘You are washing your hands; for what purpose?’ When he replies, I will turn to you,
and that will be your cue to deride him.” The food was prepared, as well as the basin
for washing the hands in. The lad was called, and he came; and while washing his hands
the brother-in-law spoke: “You are washing your hands; for what purpose?” The lad
answered, “I was called by those in that corner and this corner to move up to the
middle.” “Is that so? Was this one called to come and eat?” asked the evil-minded
brother-in-law. “No,” replied the others. “How I am shamed!” Without touching the
food, he returned to where he had previously lain, without saying a word to the sister.

<p class="first">When confined with long illness, and death draws near, a person before his demise
mutters in an indistinct and mumbling way, speaking of his relatives and his gods,
whether they be dead or whether they be living, in this manner: “So and so is coming
to get me to go.” And thus he would rave until he died. Whereupon all his relatives
mourned, and if he was greatly beloved, they extracted something from his corpse,
such as a nail, a tooth, or perhaps some hair.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19175src" href="#xd32e19175">1</a> Here is another thing: if something was seen issuing from the mouth or the eyes,
possibly a white substance accompanied with tears, the deceased truly loved his relatives;
his corpse would then be kept uninterred four or five days, or even longer, to show
their regard.

<p>In taking the corpse to be hidden,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19194src" href="#xd32e19194">5</a> it is done by two or three of his friends; not by many people. The burial is done
at night, however, not in the day time. In digging the grave, it is dug round like
a banana hole. The usual depth of the grave is up to one’s waist, that is, up to the
loin of a man. In the olden time, this grave was called a pahee (smooth place). Upon
digging, take the dirt from the grave to another place in a fine mat, or a gourd,
else the tracks would be shown. Should it be a new house, the friends of the dead
would dig from the outside till they reached within,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19197src" href="#xd32e19197">6</a> without the house owner knowing anything about it. The people thought that if the
burial place was known, the bones would be taken for fish hooks, and the flesh for
shark bait. There are some hidden graves among the precipices; others are on plains.
There is a hidden grave at Haleakala; it is called the grave of Kaawa; it is right
mauka of Nuu, on Maui. This is the way the corpse is treated before being thrown into
<span class="pageNum" id="pb572">[<a href="#pb572">572</a>]</span>that hole. When the friend of the dead takes the corpse, he takes also what the deceased
was fond of when living: If he was fond of pork, banana, or perhaps sugar-cane, etc.,
he takes them; and upon arriving at the grave, the friend of the deceased calls to
the departed ancestors<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19202src" href="#xd32e19202">7</a> first buried in that grave, thus: “So and so, here comes your descendant.” If the
corpse should keep falling until it drops into the water, and a rainbow appears, then
it is without relatives; but the corpse who has relatives is grasped by them when
the body is thrown, and is stranded on the precipice, and not dropped into the water.
After the burial [they] come home and mourn.
</p>
<p>Another thing: If the corpse is being carried, and the one he loved is far in the
rear, no progress would be made, for the deceased would demur. The one he loved should
be immediately behind, then there would be no demurring. This is what the friend of
the dead should say: “I thought you loved me, but you do not; if you act like this,
your bones will be broken.” When he has finished saying that, the corpse will acquiesce,
and it will be light work carrying it to the place of burial. The grave should be
well lined, and the corpse laid to rest, the head towards the east, the feet towards
the west.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19207src" href="#xd32e19207">8</a> It is wrong to lay the corpse with the head towards the west, for it would appear
as a ghost. When the body is buried, the friend should repeat these words: “Do not
go wandering to houses, but stay quietly here; you have food, fish and clothes.”

<p>Another thing: Some people when they see that a person is dead would strip the flesh
from the bones and make them into knives or fish-hooks; or else they would be hung
up in the house, so that the loved ones may go and see them. Some of the corpses are
taken to the sea or water and thrown in, so that they may become shark- or lizard-gods.

<p>Some say that should a person die and is buried at the edge of a river, or a spring,
or a watercourse, then his soul will enter another body such as a shark’s, or an eel’s,
or any other living body of the sea. Those that are buried by a body of fresh water
will enter that stream and become a large <i lang="haw">okuhekuhe</i> or tailed-lizard; and if buried on dry land, then they will enter the body of an
owl, and such like. These things which are entered by the souls of men become guides<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19236src" href="#xd32e19236">12</a> to their friends who are living. This is what the soul which has entered these things
would do: It would proceed and enter his friend, and when it has possessed him, the
soul would eat regular food until satisfied, then go back. And he would repeatedly
do that. And this friend, should he have any trouble on land, such as war, then the

<p>When they arrived here Malulani dwelt on Lanai, while Pele and the younger sisters
went on to Hawaii. Pele and Hiiaka lived at the volcano of Kilauea, but nobody knew
exactly where Kaohelo settled on Hawaii. Yet while so living she bore a son named
Kiha. When Kaohelo was nearing death she said to her son, “Should I die, do not bury
me at any other place, but take my body to the very navel of your grandmother, right
on top of Kilauea; then bury me there.” When Kaohelo died her son took her dead body:
that is the creeping part as well as the bush-plant part. The flesh became the creeping
vine and the bones became the bush-plant. Pele retained Kaohelo’s head, which became
the smouldering fire in the volcano; the rest of the body was thrown over<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19319src" href="#xd32e19319">21</a> to Haleakala, Maui, and to salty Kealia, Oahu; some of it was thrown on Kauai, and
some of it was left on Hawaii.
</p>
<p>When Malulani, living on Lanai, heard of the death of their youngest sister, she came
over to get her, thinking that Pele hadn’t kept her; when she arrived she did not
find her whole body. It was scattered and lost over the ground, and it was sprouting
and growing from the soil. She commenced to gather and bundle it, thinking that that
was all, as she wanted to care for it. But some time after, as she went back to Lanai,
she saw Kaohelo’s body strung and worn as leis by the people; and because she loved
her youngest sister very much she hung herself.

the fire whereby Hiiaka could not get enough sleep, she (Hiiaka) said to her older

being heated by the fire. It is better that we let our younger sister go, and let

saw her soul they greeted each other as strangers do, and he took her to his home;
passing the time pleasantly for a few minutes, Heeia asked Kaohelo, “Where are you
traveling to, and where did you come from?” She replied, “Why, Hawaii is our place
of residence with my elder sisters, but I died. And because the back of my elder sister,
Hiiaka, was heated with fire all the time, she told our eldest sister to send me away,
and that is why I have been traveling to find a place where I might dwell.”

be my wife and let me be your husband?” The idea was pleasing to the beautiful queen

<p>After they had lived for some time there was born to them a daughter, Waialani, a
beautiful and a good woman, better even than her mother. After they had lived together
for three years, she told her parents that she would go and bring Malulani from Lanai.
This was agreeable to the parents. As she went over to Hawaii, Hiiaka said to Pele,
“Say, here comes our niece.” Pele replied, “Whose niece is she? Why should I accord
her recognition?” And this matter became a source of serious quarrel between the two.
When the niece arrived at the mouth of the crater, at the place called Akanikolea,
and looked down, she noticed her aunts quarreling. And because Pele was very angry
she lighted the fire which filled the crater. Hiiaka feared the niece might die. So
she went to get her brother, Ahuimaiapakanaloa,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19341src" href="#xd32e19341">25</a> living in Nuumealani, the only one who could appease Pele. When the brother arrived
the fire subsided. Then the niece went down, and when she noticed the banana<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19344src" href="#xd32e19344">26</a> was ripe she reached out and ate some. Thus she journeyed until she got down to the
bottom, the fire meanwhile receding until it disappeared in the mouth of Pele. And
when Pele recognized their niece, she said, “I thought you would die, because I did
not recognize you, but I see your younger aunt was correct in telling me that you
are our niece.”

<p>When Hiiaka heard what they were talking about she said: “Say, do not eat that thing,
because it is the body of your mother; the ohelo which are standing up are the bones,
and the creeping ohelo is the flesh.” When Waialani heard this she was sad and sorry
because she had eaten of the body of her dear mother, so she said to Pele: “I now
vow and I tell you that I will never recognize you until I reach the grave.” That
is a Hawaiian way of separating in anger, for one to vow not to speak to the other
until death; the only way to rectify this is to kill a pig<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19356src" href="#xd32e19356">28</a> and fix the matter up, then could they recognize each other during life. If that
is not done then they keep up this enmity until death. This is customary here in Hawaii;

Then they stayed there, the women, the husband and the daughter. After some days Waialani

a hill here and a hill there until the place held many hills which are standing even

like a wonderful blossom of the mountain; Heeia made up his mind to make Hiiaka his
own, which desire was reciprocated. They became husband and wife and lived as peacefully
as the still water of Hauola. But poor Kaohelo was sad at heart because the Puulena<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19367src" href="#xd32e19367">30</a> (the cold wind of Kilauea) had gone on to Hilo, gone on to find a mate for it with

joints. The reason for calling it Manulele is because of a man with a woman. They
lived peaceably as husband and wife, but after some time there grew up in one of them
the desire to go astray, thus bringing about discord, and the husband or perhaps the
wife is taken by another. The one remaining would still be very much in love, trying
in various ways to occupy his mind, thinking this affection would soon pass away;
but no, it would not cease. Then after a while some one who knows how to intensify
love is heard of and is sent for, and upon arrival this kahuna would ask, “What ails
you?” The man would respond, “The love of wife, that is why I am ailing; I do not
desire food; I was fond of food and fish when living with my wife, but at this time
we are contending together, I do not care for food.” The kahuna would say, “That is
a sickness easily cured if I should treat you.” Then the sick man would say, “Suppose
then you treat me.” “All right,” the kahuna would say. Then he would get this cane,
that is, the Manulele, and would explain as follows: “This cane is Manulele (flying
bird); her love will fly to you, she will cease her wanderings until you two are parted
by death.” That is the name of this cane, Manulele.

<p>It is said that the bambu was brought by Hina from Kahiki. The sharpness of the bambu
at that time, strange to say, was on the outside. There were two plants that she brought
over; the bambu and a rush, and these were planted by the side of the door. When Maui,
the grandson of Hina, saw these plants growing by the side of their door, he went
to pull them; but before he could loosen them, his hands were cut by the bambu; and
when his grandmother saw that his hands were lacerated, she turned the sharp edge
of the bambu inward. That is what we see now, the sharp edge of the bambu is inside;
therefore it is clear to us that Hina introduced the bambu here in Hawaii.

dropped here and there into the sea, and the ocean current brought some and landed

<p>From there they came and landed at Lanai on the eastern side of the pali of Kaholo.
The name of the place now is Kaneapua; it is derived from the name Apua. When they
came that time they did not bring any plants, because they thought all the plants
of Kahiki grew here. And because they got in trouble and were famished, that is why
they went back to Kahiki for food. When they arrived at Kahiki, the canoes could not
land on account of the high surf.

<p>In sailing Apua sat on the <i lang="haw">manu</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19659src" href="#xd32e19659">62</a> of the canoe and directed its course properly. On their voyage the canoe was filled
with coral rock for the purpose of deceiving. While they were floating outside Kaulaku
spied the canoe. He suspected they were canoes seeking to buy food. He also thought
they did not, on account of the storm. Therefore, Kaulaku showed them a banana. Apua
saw that and he bowed his head and spoke to his people, “Show them a coral.” They
picked up a large, coarse, red coral rock and showed it. It did look like a ripe banana
outside, and Apua again said, “Tell them that what you have is banana; it has grown
and sprouted, leaves have shot forth, and it has borne fruit; the fruit has been left
in Hawaii.” And when Kaulaku heard this he said to his people, “Say, they are saying
that that is banana, and that they have it at Hawaii.” They therefore threw out the
fruit, the tree, the leaves and the suckers; the others got them, for they were sorely
beset with hunger.

Kane, the owner of the coconut?” He said he had not. The chief answered: “That is

<p>The owner of this banana field. The owner of this banana field is the one mentioned
above, that is Kahuoi. This man came from Hawaii, and he left there because he could
not agree with his parents, Kauahua and Heana. Kauahua was the father and Heana was
the mother. Why he did not agree with his parents was because this boy was lazy and
would not do any cultivating. The father continually urged the child to go to work,
but he would not heed any instructions the father gave him; therefore the father concluded
to send his son away from home. When the son was sent away he went down to the beach
and saw a canoe ready for departure. He asked the man on the canoe: “Where is the
canoe going?” Kilua answered: “The canoe is going to Maui.” Kahuoi said: “Please allow
me to go with you?” The man consented. They sailed until they came to the observation
point of land for ulua. Alau is the name of this point. On their arrival there, Kahuoi
asked Kilua: “Say, how is the canoe to be headed?” Kilua answered: “Head the canoe
for Hamoa.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19766src" href="#xd32e19766">73</a> Kahuoi changed to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb600">[<a href="#pb600">600</a>]</span>bailing place<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19771src" href="#xd32e19771">74</a> and Kilua took up the paddle.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19774src" href="#xd32e19774">75</a> While they were paddling along, a large wave sprang up behind them, and Kahuoi called
out to Kilua: “Say, Kilua, keep the canoe on the crest,” and they raced along until
they arrived in the harbor above mentioned. Kahuoi then went and lived at Keakamanu;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19777src" href="#xd32e19777">76</a> and because he could not get enough to eat he kept wandering on until he found a
favorable place, right above Waiohonu;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19781src" href="#xd32e19781">77</a> while living there it entered his mind to plant bananas for himself, because he had
noticed bananas growing about, and that is the banana field which we are hearing of.

<p>Famine was raging below Waiohonu, near Hana, Maui. The children, the men and the women
were in great need. The famine had even reached as far as the <i>konohiki’s</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19801src" href="#xd32e19801">80</a> place of residence, and the konohiki was also in distress on account of the famine.
After that a widow had an idea to go and search for food for them. She said to the
parents of her husband: “I am going to search for some mountain <i lang="haw">kalo</i> for food for us; do you prepare the wood. You wait for me, and if the day passes
by without my return, then you may conclude that I am dead.” She then started off
to look for wild kalo. She followed the course of a stream. While going towards the
mountain not a kalo could she find. It was already picked by those who had gone <span class="pageNum" id="pb602">[<a href="#pb602">602</a>]</span>before. She kept on until she came to the tall woods when she found some mountain
kalo. Others who had sought for food had not gone as far as this. She gathered enough
for a large pile which she bundled conveniently for carrying. Then she kept going
mountainwards, following the stream. She saw cane stretching out on the ground and
then rising again, and bananas till they were over-ripe. She hastened to break some
cane and to get some bananas, thinking to take home a bundle of sugar-cane. Kahuoi
heard the cane snapping and the noise of the banana trees as they were thrown down.
So he went along to see what it was, and saw this beautiful woman. When the woman
saw the man, she was afraid, and said to him: “If this banana field and this cane
are yours, I beseech for pardon before you for my wrong.” Kahuoi answered and said:
“Why should it be wrong to take of the eatables? One must indeed be famished to search
the source of food.” And because he was kindly disposed, the woman said: “Perhaps
you have a wife?” He answered: “I have no wife; I came alone from my country. My parents
were tired of me because I would not do any cultivating, therefore I was sent away,
and I found this place and lived here, and now I have met you.”
</p>
<p>Then the woman said: “Will you then be a husband to me, and let me be your wife? Because
I lost my husband a few weeks ago.” Then they lived as husband and wife.

went to their cultivating, while the children went to the stream to dig ditches. While
so digging, the sister’s ditch was broken prematurely, and she was carried along by
the water without the brother’s knowledge. While the brother was digging away at his
ditch he happened to glance around and the sister was nowhere in sight, so he started
to hunt for her, thinking he could find her quickly. He saw her at Paliakoae, so he
chased after her. When he arrived there she had got to Waiailio,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19818src" href="#xd32e19818">82</a> and thus he followed after her until she was finally carried out into the ocean.
At that time she threw her ivory necklace upon the beach at a place known as Waioaoaku,
and it is so named unto this day. The brother was also carried right along, and when

they grew at Waialeale. Some were pulled up by Moikeha and brought by him from Kauai;
and without his knowing the kinds of plants they were, he planted them at Halawa,
on Oahu. When Moikeha saw that the plants grew he went and told the owner of them,
Oilikukaheana, who said the name was Paholei. Moikeha waited until the plants grew
large, and because he had forgotten the name, he went to Ewa. This was the time when
Ewa and Halawa were living<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19930src" href="#xd32e19930">97</a> separately; Halawa was not available to every one, hence the saying: “Halawa is not

found that the roots had grown large. So he pulled up the plants, roots <span class="pageNum" id="pb608">[<a href="#pb608">608</a>]</span>and leaves, and brought them to Ewa. Ewa said: “Let me first eat of this plant, and

<p>Awa was a valuable article in the olden time; a great deal of it was bought by the
people for drinking and for medicinal purposes. This is what is done if for a sick
person: it is used as a medicine together with a black pig for its accompaniment.
Awa is chewed and placed in a container, and when there is sufficient it is mixed
and strained and poured into the cups; then the priest<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19972src" href="#xd32e19972">99</a> prays to the guardian spirit, sprinkling some awa for them. Then drink of the awa,

by the gods. When the god comes on a visit and sits<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e19978src" href="#xd32e19978">101</a> on one, awa is quickly gotten ready for the deity; it is hastily chewed, prepared
and drank up. And every time the god visits the same process is gone through until
one gets inflamed; and when you see some one blear-eyed it reminds you of the following
saying: “Inflamed! Inflamed! First go down to Piheka. What food will you have to eat?

purposes, a different petition is offered for the hewing of that canoe tree. If it
is intended for sale, another prayer is used at its felling. There are also separate
divisions in the prayer for cutting off the branches, the trunk, for shaping it, for
hauling it down to the beach, for the construction and for launching it into the sea.

it is a creeping vine. But I wish to tell you of what I know at my place, because
when I asked my friends, they had a different explanation about the maile ku honua
on the mountains of the different islands of our group. This maile has leaves somewhat
round, though some are long, but not very small and slender like the mailelaulii,<a class="noteRef" id="n614.2src" href="#n614.2">120</a> but more like the orange leaves. In the forests of my place, when the maile first
comes up, it has one stem and one branch; the branch, slender and young, <span class="pageNum" id="pb616">[<a href="#pb616">616</a>]</span>is from a yard to a fathom in length, and this is covered with green, fragrant leaves.
The bark comes off readily when stripped by the hand of man, leaving only the woody
part.

like the wiliwili canoe. When the time comes that the fish <i lang="haw">auau</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20272src" href="#xd32e20272">134</a> moves in schools, the owner of this wiliwili canoe would go out, followed by others
in other kinds of canoes; and when they have caught the fish, they would return, and
the man in the wiliwili canoe would divide the fish. That is not all: it is made by
some people into tinder to continue the fire, and is used by others for purposes of
smoking. This is what I have found out through inquiring among friends. They have
told me what they knew, and with what I know has increased it somewhat; perhaps there
are many other things, but I do not know what they are. This is all I have found.

<p>This is a beautiful woman, and this ohia puakea was named after a beautiful girl named
Waiakea, for she lived there until she was old, then she said like this: “Where art
thou, Aulii?” Aulii answered: “Here am I.” “Go and get my ohelo fruits and bring them
back; Kealia (Oahu) has them. Should he ask you, ‘What do you want here?’ then say
to him, ‘I came to get the ohelo fruits of your daughter Waiakea, for she is very
fond of them.’ ” Then those fruits were given. And when Aulii returned and arrived
at the house of Waiakea, she asked: “Where are the fruits?” “Here they are!” answered
Aulii, and when Waiakea looked she realized that they were not what she wanted; then
the fruits were called “puakea”; this tree has white flowers, and its fruit is also
white when it is ripe; it is palatable when eaten. It has <span class="pageNum" id="pb622">[<a href="#pb622">622</a>]</span>one round seed split in two parts; the birds are fond of the nectar of its flowers.
The bird snarers used the branches on which the flowers were thick to put their gum
on, and when a bird was caught the snarer would call out, “Snared, snared is my bird,”
etc. The bird must be secured as quickly as possible. Its trunk, as also its branches,
is used for firewood.

<p>This ohia lehua is different; it is not like the other ohias mentioned above. This
ohia was named thus because of the anger of Poopapale; because Akahi’s (a bird’s)
nest with its eggs were continually falling down. Poopapale conceived the idea of
breaking off the branches (of the ohia tree) until they came to naught. But when he
commenced to break them, Kalehua (the lehua) cried out on account of great pain; then
Poopapale said to Kalehua: “Behold here you are a person, and yet you have been constantly
harassing me!” Then Kalehua spoke up: “Let me live.” Poopapale replied: “Of what benefit
will it be to me to let you live?” Kalehua answered Poopapale and said: “If you will
spare me you will be benefited.” Poopapale asked: “What benefit?” “I have food and
water. Should you go visiting and you get into trouble, let me furnish the food and
water; thus you and your friends would be revived to continue your journey.” Thus
came the name of this lehua, from Kalehua, a beautiful woman. I do not know her parents;
that is the story I have gathered. This tree is also used by children for snaring
birds. The full name of Poopapale was O’upoopapale.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20365src" href="#xd32e20365">143</a>

<p>Some people say that these trees are indigenous to Hawaii nei.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e20410src" href="#xd32e20410">148</a> Perhaps it is so, according to the ancient history of Hawaii nei; but there are some
who say that these trees came by the mouth of Ukeke; a bird which came from Kahiki
bringing them here to Hawaii. The bird, however, belonged to Hawaii nei. Some say
that these trees were obtained by Koea from the throat of Waia; this tree, however,
was hidden by Waia in his throat, but because Koea was provoked on account of the
continual breaking of the wood that he would get, he turned to Kawau the oldest man
and said: “Say, what are the oldest trees that you know of from your youth to your
old age?” Kawau answered: “There is still a tree, but you can not get it, because
Waia is a strong man though somewhat secretive.” “And how can it be obtained?” asked
Koea. “Here is how you may get it: should you go and he should ask you, then you reply,
‘I came to get me some wood;’ that is how you must answer.” Koea went until he came
into the presence of Waia, and Waia asked, “Why are you here?” Koea answered, “I came
to get my wood, because I began to cut down all the other wood, but they do not last;
so I asked Kawau, and he directed me to you, and that is why I came to you.” Waia
said, “There is some wood if you will consent to my desire.” Koea answered, “I consent.”
Waia then said to him, “Hold my throat. After you have held it for some time, should
some women appear, catch hold of them and you will be benefited. If I should die,
do you take care of my throat.” So he went and held fast to the throat of Waia for
quite a while. The women appeared, so he grabbed them and held them fast; he also
at the same time still held the throat of Waia. That was one of the methods of securing
this plant: from the throat of Waia.

<p>The makalii mat is braided thus: rend into narrow strips [the lauhala] according to
the size [of the strand] wanted by the one preparing the mat, then the same is braided
on a board. This is what I have seen as I remember it. The makoloa mat is braided,
but not on a board. When you lie on it, it is smooth. I know nothing about the lauhala
mat. The akaakai (rush) mat is braided like the lauhala. It is cold when you first
lie on it; it takes some time to warm it up. The alolua mat: in the braiding of this
two lauhala strands are placed back to back and are braided in that way. Any kind
of lauhala would do for this, old lauhala or young lauhala. The puahala mat has a
foundation like the flower of the <i lang="haw">hala</i> (pandanus) when cut; it has serrated edges. Any kind of lauhala will do. I know nothing
about the makanui mat. The pakea mat: I am a little doubtful about this mat, but this
is the explanation offered by some: the pakea mat is a mat made of the midrib of the
lauhala; after the leafy parts are separated from it, this part is taken and braided
into a mat. Some say that it is a makoloa mat, and is the whitest mat, not a spot
either red or black or other color could be seen on it. The pueo mat is a mat which
has large braids. I have not seen that mat. I have not seen the <span class="corr" id="xd32e20575" title="Source: launiu">launui</span> mat, either, nor the hiialo mat. It is said that the kumukolu has three layers at
the starting point, and the kumulua has two; but I do not know what is meant by that.
The palau is an old and worn mat, generally small, used for sitting by fireplaces,
and used on the veranda outside or inside the doorway. The palau and the aneenee are
the same thing. The pawehe mat is a makoloa mat. I do not know how it is made; no
explanation has been given.

firewood, at [the rate of] eight dollars ($8.00) per pile. That is one value. Here
are some of its uses: yoke for oxen, poi boards, boards for houses, posts for houses,

<p>When the people arrive at the place where the canoe was left, preparations are made
for dragging it. A rope is tied to the crease prepared for it, and when that is ready
then the procession is set from where the rope is tied to the canoe crease to the
end of the rope far ahead. Strong men are placed at the end of the rope, so that the
rope would be kept taut when being pulled, and would not slacken, tangle, and hurt
the men when the canoe slides down a precipice.

<p>When the canoe is dragged until it is brought to a moderately steep hill where it
is impossible for many to pull together on account of the steepness of the hill, a
rearrangement of the people is made, and fewer men are required to pull it down the
hill; it is then that we realize the skill of the man who guides the passage of the
canoe, and it is then also that he shows his great ability to the people. When the
preparations are complete, the man who will steer the canoe down the hill rides it:
those <span class="pageNum" id="pb634">[<a href="#pb634">634</a>]</span>who were selected commence pulling and the canoe moves along until the canoe attains
a good speed, when the men who are pulling desist and the canoe director takes charge

<p>If the road be rough, the canoe can be shifted to a smooth place; if a large tree
or a stone stand in the way, or the road be crooked, we think the canoe would be broken,
yet when it is coasting it is like sliding down a smooth-surfaced hill; because it
is the man guiding who wrecks or saves the canoe. Arriving on the flat the multitude
drags again, and thus they go until the house is reached. But if it is a half-witted
man who directs the canoe, or a man with little ability, this will surely occur: trouble
will follow from the outset. I saw this happen continually at my birthplace.

<p>If the priest is hewing a canoe in a house, then the rule is that an aha cord be stretched
across the door of the house from side to side, so that some men would not enter to
talk, thereby diverting the attention of the canoe-building priest, and the canoe
be broken by careless hewing, thus causing trouble. Hence the aha cord is placed across
the door, so that a person would come and talk from the outside, and be unable to

<p>The following is the way of procuring wauke: before Christianity was brought here,
and the goods of the foreigners were obtained, the things which a person used in supplying
his needs, he used to get a bambu and split it. Then he would look for good bambu
knives, sharp when used for cutting. Or else, he looked for a sharp pahoa stone that
could be used for cutting. Then he went up to where the wauke grew and cut it with
the stone adze which he made or with the bambu, until he had enough, at the same time
stripping them. Because when cutting the lower part, the part near the bottom, it
is cut completely around through the bark to the wood; the bark is easily pulled off;
this is continued until sufficient has been secured according to one’s desire. Then
he stopped cutting. He next trimmed off the outside bark, and when that was done it
was sorted in equal lengths and set properly in a pile. When sufficient was piled
for a bundle which could be carried on the back it was securely fastened, and one
would return home. On reaching the house it [the wauke] was left in the water until
soft; after six days, eight days, ten days or perhaps twenty days, it was taken out
of the water.

<p>If the house is to be pili-thatched, that is with the space between the battens equal
to four fingers, then prepare a pointed stick having two eyes, one at one end and
one in the middle. This stick measures about one and a half hands in length. If the

first thatch on two battens, then another two, and so keep agoing until sufficient
have been started. In piercing string holes they must alternate, and not run in one
line, lest the house leak. It is well to alternate the placing of cords, so that they
would appear irregular. In preparing the lauhala, however, the thorny edges are stripped

one that is red, and the wood from which to make it is ohia. After the halakea is

<p>When the house is trimmed erect the halakea, the upright in the middle supporting
the ridge. When the halakea is in place construct the door. The proper woods generally
used for a door frame are the ulu (breadfruit) and ohia. When this is completed the
woman braids a mat for covering for the door, because that was the door of the houses
of Hawaii nei in the olden time. Sometimes, however, a door is constructed like a
net, and the place to which this door is attached is over the passage way: when closing,
lower it, and when opening, roll it up. When the door frames are placed in position
that is the time to cut the <i lang="haw">piko</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21177src" href="#xd32e21177">209</a> of the house; that is, trim those ragged lauhala leaves which hang over the doorway.

<p>If a person desired to construct a house it was done in this manner: the owner of
the house prepared the foundation by leveling the ground. Holes were then dug for
the four corner posts to the proper depth when these posts were set in; small stones

to another, and indicate along it the places for digging holes for the intervening
posts. Then dig there until all the holes are completed. In erecting the posts, set
them in line with the corner posts. Implant them as firmly as the corner posts; those

Upon arrival at the mountain, the construction is very rapid; this house could be

of the sea until it proudly stood like the sharp-pointed clouds which appear in the
heavens. Some time after it had grown to quite a height, Pele set forth on her journey
here to Hawaii, thinking she would soon arrive here, but it proved otherwise. On her
way she struck the place where this pandanus tree grew and she was strangled by the
sharp thorns of this lauhala, with us human beings, it seemed, helping from this side;
Pele struggled by using her divine powers, but she could not extricate herself. Soon
after, her brother, Paao by name, appeared, with a gourd of sea-water. Said Pele,
“I am in trouble indeed, brother.” Then he climbed up and from on top poured out the
sea-water; the young leaves wilted and Pele was freed. Because she was full of anger
Pele climbed on top and pulling out the leaf-buds, threw them hither and thither.
Some landed here on Hawaii. That is the reason it grows here on Hawaii. The place
of its first growth was Kohala, Hawaii; therefore Pele was the one who brought it
here to Hawaii.

that the breasts of all females were to be cut off; and if he saw a man with well
tattooed hands, or with good hair, or a woman with good hair, he immediately gave
orders to have the hand or the head cut off. There were other cruel practices carried
on by this chief. Owaia<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21470src" href="#xd32e21470">222</a> was another cruel chief. It is said that his time was a very bad period, full of
debasing pleasures.

<p class="first">During the month of Ikuwa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21505src" href="#xd32e21505">225</a> occurs the rain called Pohakoeleele;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21508src" href="#xd32e21508">226</a> on the day called Hua<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21511src" href="#xd32e21511">227</a> at noon, a person goes to plant. These are the names of the stalks to be propagated:
<i lang="haw">hualani</i>, <i lang="haw">hokeo</i>, <i lang="haw">lopa</i>, <i lang="haw">likolehua</i> and <i lang="haw">kawelo</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21530src" href="#xd32e21530">228</a> This is the method of planting: he takes three stalks, separating them one from the
other with his fingers, and plants them. He leaves them until two months have passed;
he goes to inspect them, and if he finds that they have grown well he says this: “The
future [living] is provided for, the growth is good.” But if when he arrives, they
are dead or drying up, he would feel grieved because they did not do well. The farmers
know there is a time when plants do not grow well; that is the winter season when
rains are plentiful and the shoots will die. But if a planter waits until the month
of Ikiiki,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21533src" href="#xd32e21533">229</a> of misty rain, that is when the rain is light and is easily scattered by the wind,
on the day of Mohalu<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21536src" href="#xd32e21536">230</a> in the month of Ikiiki, [that] is the month for him to plant in the manner described
above. These are the names of the potatoes to be planted: <i lang="haw">waipalupalu</i>, <i lang="haw">kokoakeawe</i>, <i lang="haw">kuapai</i>, <i lang="haw">heauau</i> and <i lang="haw">haole</i>. He waits until the months of Kaaona<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21555src" href="#xd32e21555">231</a> and Hinaiaeleele<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21559src" href="#xd32e21559">232</a> are past when he goes again to look, and he finds that some are dead and some are
growing. This is what he says: “My wife and children are saved by the baldheaded one.”
He waits for some time longer until the grass grows, then he weeds it; this [weeding]
is sufficient until the time that the potato is ripe. After weeding, leave it for
many days; when the planter comes again and hills up the soil. If any potato is found
while hilling up the dirt, that is, the fruit in between the plants growing on the
vine, he breaks off the first potato. He returns, lights a fire in the imu, cooks
the potato until done, and brings it to the house. He sits beside the doorway and
prays thus: “Ye large black cloud hanging below the eye of the narrow pointed clouds,
give shade, protecting shade; guard this our garden, O Keaonui;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21562src" href="#xd32e21562">233</a> do thou cast shade over this our garden, O Keaonui; shade thou from that corner to
this corner; shade thou from that side to this side; shade not another’s garden lest
you be scolded for shutting out the sun and chilling the owner of that garden. O Keaonui,
shade thou this our field; shade thou the hills, shade thou the leaves of our food,
so that the plants would grow and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb664">[<a href="#pb664">664</a>]</span>hills be filled with potatoes. O ye Keaonui, shade our garden from the head to the
bottom, from the upper to the lower side; hallowed is the prayer; it is free.”

Welo,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21593src" href="#xd32e21593">239</a> Pookole (short head) is the rain, that is the rain which we style a cloud-burst;
then the farmer proceeds to crop off stalks. Here are the names of the different kinds
of stalks which he gathers: <i lang="haw">pae</i>, <i lang="haw">apo</i>, <i lang="haw">kapapa</i>, <i lang="haw">mohihi</i>, <i lang="haw">uli</i> and <i lang="haw">paa</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21615src" href="#xd32e21615">240</a> He wraps these stalks in bundles and leaves them until the days when the Pleiades
rise in the morning, when he proceeds to plant them. He plants them thus: he takes
six stalks and keeps them separated as mentioned above; after planting, he waits for
a number of days; then during the month of Nana,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21618src" href="#xd32e21618">241</a> on the day of Kane,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21621src" href="#xd32e21621">242</a> he goes to look at the potato field, and finds it is injured; that is, the stalks
are all eaten by cutworms, some have come off and some are dead. During the month
of Kaulua,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21624src" href="#xd32e21624">243</a> on the day called Lono, in the evening, he goes to crop off some more stalks. These
are the names of the stalks he gathers: <i lang="haw">hualani</i>, <i lang="haw">poni</i>, <i lang="haw">loepaa</i>, <i lang="haw">awapuhi</i>, <i lang="haw">uahiapele</i>, <i lang="haw">pikonui</i> and <i lang="haw">kupa</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21650src" href="#xd32e21650">244</a> He bundles these and sets them aside as described above.

He plants them in this way: he first distributes
the stalks among the hills, eight to each hill; then he plants them. When this is
done he waits until the stormy months are over, and long after that, in the month
of Kaaona, he goes to throw up the earth on the hills of the potatoes; when he first
obtains potato, whether in between hills or from the running vine, he returns with
wood, lights the fire in the imu and cooks the potato until it is done. He prays in
this manner: “Keaonui, hanging below the eye of the narrow pointed clouds, come to
partake of the food.” When the months of Welehu,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21661src" href="#xd32e21661">247</a> Makalii<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21665src" href="#xd32e21665">248</a> and Hinaiaeleele are past, and during the month of Nana on the day called Mauli,
he shows off before men and women, and placing a wreath of flowers on his head, he
would sally forth to dig potatoes in the presence of these men and women. Then the
improvidents would call out, “Say, this is my potato hill;” [and another] “And <i>this</i> is mine;” they would forbid each other by saying, “Don’t you come to get mine.” They
would then dig and obtain potatoes. But they are not of large size; they are small.
There is one way of keeping the family in food, [that is] to care for the leaves [of
the potato]; that is the food with which to feed the family if there be no tubers.
One would say thus: “Anyway, these are not the months when potatoes bear plentifully;
these are months when leaves grow rank and the stalks swell large. This month is the
time to plant in order to bear.” On the day called Hilo the planter obtains some stalks,
the ones called <i lang="haw">kola</i>, <i lang="haw">nika</i>, <i lang="haw">pukeleawe</i>, <i lang="haw">hiiaka</i>, <i lang="haw">lapa</i>, and <i lang="haw">huamoa</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21689src" href="#xd32e21689">249</a> Prepare them in the manner previously stated. When the day called Hoaka arrives then
is the time to plant; set them out in the manner explained above; and when Ikiiki
is past the planter would be relieved, for he realizes that his family is saved; the
days called Olekukahi, Olekulua and Olekupau are the days during which to hill up
potatoes; then he waits until the days called Mohalu, Hua, Akua, Hoku, Mahealani and
Kulu, and the last day, Akua, he visits the potato field at the time that the constellation
called Taurus rises; arriving at the corner of his field, he prays in this manner:
“O Kanepuaa,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21692src" href="#xd32e21692">250</a> root towards the mountain, root towards the sea; root towards the wind, root towards
the calm, root in the middle of this our potato field! O Kanepuaa! do thou root from
that corner to this corner, from that border to this border, from that side to this
side, so fruit would appear at the end of the stalk, along the stalk, and the roots
which creep between hills.”

potatoes on account of those big tubers.) The husband and wife then return and cook

<p>This kukui grove grows on this island of Maui, at Makawao. It was famous because the
chiefs went there in the olden times, and perhaps even to this day; it was noted as
a place often visited by strangers. It was also the place where were procured the
kukui nuts for the chiefs, for the kernel of its nuts was fragrant and good to the

dried a person goes for it and gathers plenty, then he returns to the house, cooks

in fishing for uhu or in spying for squid; if it were not for the kukui, these kinds

<p>Here is still another use of the kukui fruit: It is made into oil. It is first gathered,
and when there is plenty it is cooked in the imu; when cooked it is cracked and the
shell separated from the kernel. The kernel is made into oil by pounding it on a board
until it is pulverized; then a large smooth <i lang="haw">ala</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21925src" href="#xd32e21925">268</a> stone is rolled on this pulverized kukui meat. The juice is then run into a container

<p class="first">There are two places where breadfruit is to be found. 1. At Kaawaloa, Kona, Hawaii.
Man was the origin of the breadfruit of that place. Before his death he had said to
his children: “If I die, both of you watch the tree that may grow at the door of our
house; its fruit shall be your food; the hands and hairs are the roots of that breadfruit
tree, the legs are its branches, the testicle is the fruit thereon.<span class="corr" id="xd32e21938" title="Not in source">”</span> At that time that was the food that saved this whole family. At the time the forty
thousand gods and the four hundred thousand gods saw the fruit of this breadfruit
tree, they went and plucked it and tried to eat it green, but it was not palatable;
they then tried cooking it on hot coals and found it relishable. They spoke to Kane
and Kanaloa<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21940src" href="#xd32e21940">269</a> of the sweetness of this fruit; to which they replied that the fruit was no other
than the testes of a certain man who is now dead. At this they vomited until they
were exhausted; <span class="pageNum" id="pb678">[<a href="#pb678">678</a>]</span>they started to vomit in Kona and continued through the mountains till they reached
Waipio. That is why the breadfruit trees became so plentiful, at that time, because
the gods vomited on their way through the mountains, hence its wide spread.

<p>2. At Puuloa, Oahu. Its breadfruit plant came from Kanehunamoku,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e21947src" href="#xd32e21947">270</a> brought by two men of Puuloa who were out fishing and were blown off by a heavy wind
and rain storm and landed at the uninhabited land, save gods only. Therefore by them
it was introduced at Puuloa and planted in a large excavation where it grew and bore
fruit, which they ate. Haumea and others afterwards knew of this breadfruit tree having
been brought away secretly by these men, so she came to see it herself and made a
visit to these islands, but this variety of tree was not found. That is the reason
she scattered the breadfruit in all lands; hence its wide distribution.
</p>
<p>This land of Kanehunamoku is in Kahiki, a land not found by explorers who are endeavoring
to discover, because this is a mythical land; if this land is seen by man it is then
submerged in the ocean, it can never be found, and so continues on. The good things
of that land are many; the living-water of Kane and Kanaloa is found there; those
who have died and their bodies turned into ashes can be brought back to life by that
water.

<p>On commencing the cultivation the men first burn off a large field selected for the
purpose, then clear it nicely, throwing the stones aside till the field is in good
condition. Then the planter awaits the fall of the first shower of rain. At the fall
of the first shower the spirit of the planter is gladdened, the eyes are gratified;
he then waits for one more shower that his field may be thoroughly soaked. When the
second rain comes on the evening of that day, the planter goes in search of taro-tops<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22011src" href="#xd32e22011">275</a> (<i lang="haw">huli</i>). These are the kinds of seed chosen, which are planted in dry land: 1, <i lang="haw">elepaio</i>, a species of taro with spotted leaves; 2, <i lang="haw">apuwaipiialii</i>; 3, <i lang="haw">lehua-ku-i-ka-wao</i>; 4, <i lang="haw">kumu</i>; 5, <i lang="haw">manini</i> and <i lang="haw">ape</i>. Tie the seed plants into a bundle, and on the morning of the next day proceed to
the prepared field; dig as many holes therein and plant out the taro-tops selected;
when the field is planted then the farmer watches the field for the growth of weeds,
and at their appearance he takes his wooden oo and clears the growing weeds or grass.
This method of cultivation is called “<i lang="haw">oloolohio</i>.” This work must be done regularly until the young leaves of the seed-plant make
their appearance; sometimes three or four leaves are seen, then the planter separates
the planted taro-tops (hulis). because if they are not separated and the soil pressed
down firmly, it was said by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb682">[<a href="#pb682">682</a>]</span>people of old, the bulb would become poor and slender instead of being full and rounded.
But, if the planter regularly and daily separates the decaying leaf-stalk and presses
the soil around the taro plants until it nearly matures, whereby, they say, the taro
is extra large, they are full and round, not long and slim.

<p>This was the way they cultivated wet-land taro in the olden time. The first duty of
the farmer to perform was to clear the weeds; when that is done, then the banks must
be made solid to prevent leakage. When a taro patch is dried, then the farmer digs
the patch in blocks (<i lang="haw">eka</i>) and turns it over, places the blocks against or along the banks, and the remaining
dirt, or earth for the patch; because if stones only were placed along the banks the
water would all flow through it. Therefore, the earth will help it. After the patch
is all dug and in good order, nothing lacking, then the farmer waits a few days, allowing
time to soften the earth; when he knows that the time for planting is at hand, he
procures the bundle of taro tops and carries them to the patch. The planter then begins
to make large<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22077src" href="#xd32e22077">279</a> mounds of earth and five men cannot encircle with their hands. After this is done,

</p>
<p>Our grandparents these days are enjoying a period of enlightenment and advancement;
also the receipt of proper implements for performing the work. The dry-land planting
of taro at this time is similar to what our grandparents did in the past, for the
first thing to do is to burn off the field; that being done well, the stones are all
thrown aside along the borders of the field; the act of digging holes for the plants
is then begun; taro-tops are planted; the taro-tops that are to be set out at this
day are the same as planted by the ancients; there are no other seed plants, and the
way of cultivating is similar to that of the olden time in the treatment and care
of the taro-tops, loosening the soil and pressing it down, that the bulb may be plump
are identical with that of that time. Here is where it differs, in their manner of
praying. At that time they prayed when the food matured: at this time, no. Perhaps
there is where it varies slightly, providing the people of that time observed its
practice.

<p>I have seen my grandparents carry their taro-tops and plant them among the ohia grove.
The first thing they did was to remove the akolea<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22144src" href="#xd32e22144">282</a> fern till it was well cleared, after which the taro tops were planted and the fern
leaves were then spread all over the planted field, that the dampness may be retained
and the whole field be kept moist. Weeds will not make their appearance until the
taro is almost matured; at the same time adhere to the practice of the old people
in constantly loosening the soil, and when you see the taro at maturity it is extra
large, exceeding in size that planted on the open plain. A number of residents of
my locality moved to the ohia grove to take up taro culture at that time, and the
crops were large. This concludes my observations of my grandparents’ practice concerning
their method of taro cultivation.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, concerning the planting of taro in wet-land and things relating to
its method. Respecting this subject, in my opinion it is needless for me to reiterate
my remarks concerning the present method of preparing the patch, also of planting,
for the reason that each and everyone of us are familiar with our every day duties,
and it is unnecessary for me to relate it at this time, for the old-time method is
that being observed and practiced by us, such as the loosening of the taro tops, pressing
them down in the soil, and things relating thereto. Therefore, it is clear to us that
though the recount shows a difference in the methods of culture it agrees in its divisions.

lived there. The reason for this coming was because the king was fond of maika, that

<p>While Kamehameha lived at Kaunakahakai he had nothing with which to amuse himself.
He sent his friend Kikane to get stones from Kahekili who was living on Oahu. When
he sailed he went alone. Arriving in the presence of Kahekili, they wailed together,
after which Kahekili inquired: “What does the chief desire that he sent you to me?”
Kikane answered: “I came to get the stone for a plaything for your child; we came
together and he is now residing at Kaunakahakai, Molokai; he sent me to come to you.”

<p>Kahekili again inquired: “What stone does he desire?” He replied: “The stone at the

Do not mistake, my friends, this kind of a stone; it is made in the way above stated
and called <i lang="haw">ulu</i>. Kahekili handed over the stones saying: “This, the stone called Hiupa, is not to
be cast on the windy side, lest it be struck by the force of the wind and be unsteady
in its rolling, for it is a light stone; it is to be cast on the calm side; but this,
Kaikimakua, is to be cast on the windward side for it is a heavy stone. The names

realized that he would be killed, so he reached for a cord and tied around his person.
The men whom Kamehameha sent to him said: “It is high time for you to be girding up
your loins; you will be killed for being cruel to others, for rebelling, for disobeying
the laws of the chief.” Then Keoua and his retinue wailed with loud voices. Kamanawa

he was taken and baked in the imu. After Keoua died, one of his attendants, Kaoleioku,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e22246src" href="#xd32e22246">289</a> begged Kamehameha, “O ye chief! grant me protection that would save me.” Kamehameha

water of Ahukini (perhaps this water is still at Kawaihae at this time). He persisted
in his refusal, saying that could not save him. So Kamehameha granted him the mamalahoa,
saying at the same time, “No subject and no chief shall take your life; you may live!”
The other chiefs objected to this [gift] and said that mamalalaau should be given
instead, meaning by this a law which would allow of his being killed; but Kamehameha
would not concede, for he had already spoken. Then one of Keoua’s attendants, Wailama,

<p>Let us turn aside and glance at Kawelo. While Kawelo dwelt peacefully with his parents
a desire entered his mind to go sea bathing, which was his favorite pastime from his
infancy up to the time of his death. In his eighteenth year a secret longing prompted
Kawelo to seek the wives of his half-brother, Aikanaka, the king of Kauai. Said he
to Heulu, his father: “How amazing is the greatness of my desire for the wives of
my lord brother! By what means may they be obtained?” Whereupon the father asked:
“Do you really wish the wives of your lord to be yours?” “Yes,” Kawelo replied. “Here
is the means whereby they may be won: let me teach you how to fish.”

<p>So they entered upon the task of learning, and not very long after the instruction
was begun Kawelo became proficient. Wherefore he immediately went out to fish. In
a short period of fishing a great heap of fish was caught. He patiently waited for,
but failed to secure the women; so he said to the father: “I can not in the least
obtain the wives of my elder brother.” “Then go farming,” answered the father. He

what a great pity would it then be that our bones should be allowed to bleach in the
sun.” The other remarked: “Does he know what he has in store?” Soon after this, Aikanaka
summoned all the men to assemble; no man should stay back, and if any was absent from

be thrown. Kamalama said to the ulus: “There is no hope left! Seek your strength in
order to escape.” The ulus began to press forward. They all fought on furiously from
early morning until the sun had passed the zenith; two ulus still survived, and nine
were killed. The names of the remaining ulus were Kauluikapapaakea and the friend
of Kawelo, Kamalama. Nevertheless, the greater part of the men had been <span class="pageNum" id="pb710">[<a href="#pb710">710</a>]</span>killed by Kamalama; and had the men been less in number they would all have been slain
by Kamalama. They moved towards the sea, with a hope of securing aid should his friend<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23753src" href="#xd32e23753">41</a> notice [them]. The greater force pushed the battle on until Kauluikapapaakea had

up. The manner of its preparation was like the rolling up of a tobacco bundle, though
not exactly, for he was laid out at full length and placed on top.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e23854src" href="#xd32e23854">54</a> The rope with which it was fastened was wauke rope. The king, Aikanaka, had previously

the reason for the blackness was because of the continuous bruisings by the stones.
Nevertheless, Kawelo was lifted and conveyed to the place they had started the fire,

who desired to inspect this hill reach it. Immediately the ladder was drawn up and
placed on the top; Kawelo said: “Listen! If in the course of staying, one from below
should be sent hither, and should call out to let down the ladder, do not consent.
Instead, say to him that only with strength can the top be reached.” “It is agreed,”
the brother-in-law replied.

the brother-in-law espied the man who had come up and began to weep. When the wife
heard the wailing of the husband, she said: “What are these tears for?” The other
answered: “Why question you regarding these tears; they are for death. Ill-fate will
soon come.” Not very long afterwards, the one that had been sent to inquire after
the corpse of the deceased called out: “Lower the ladder that I may ascend to examine
the body of the dead one.” The other replied with fear: “The ladder will not be lowered
for you. Only with the greatest strength can the top be inspected.” The man replied:
“Whence, indeed, is that power of resistance of yours? I supposed you were stationed
to care for the corpse, but lo! you two are placed to resist. What of it, anyhow?
I am going back and report this action of yours to the king; I will explain that the
